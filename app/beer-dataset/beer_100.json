If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

The 2013 edition of Burnt Rock Vanilla Porter won Gold at Montreal’s Mondial de la Bière.\r\n\r\nTasting Notes\r\n\r\nWith rich, luxuriant vanilla aromas reminiscent of fine pipe tobacco, selected dark malts offer up balancing chocolate and coffee nuances for this medium-bodied beer.

Burton Baton sits on the wood for about a month.\r\n\r\nWhen enjoying the Burton Baton, you'll find an awesome blend of the citrus notes from Northwestern hops melding with woody, vanilla notes from the oak. The wood also tends to mellow the 10% of the beer - so tread cautiously!\r\n\r\nBurton Baton is brewed and released three times per year.",

Note that \"earthy, herbal English-variety hop character\" is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. Medium to high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma should be evident. This medium-bodied pale ale has low to medium malt flavor and aroma. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to strong. Chill haze may be in evidence only at very cold temperatures. The absence of diacetyl is desirable, though, diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels.",
