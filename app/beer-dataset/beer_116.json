These beers are highly attenuated and have a perceptively deceiving high alcoholic character-being light to medium bodied rather than full bodied.

With the color of a friar’s robe, it has aromas of caramel and alcohol preserved fruit (pear, plum and morel) with light roasts. The mouth is warm and complex with an unexpected dry finish that makes drinking easier.\r\n“To all those who still hold dreams and will never cease to search for the happiness they deserve”.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPerfecting this beer was certainly challenging. Countless variations were jettisoned before arriving at the refined version we are proud to brew today. The current Chimera is most easily compared to a Belgian Dark Strong Ale. I travelled frequently in Belgium as a young man and I always enjoyed very much its beers. Today’s Chimera resembles those beers that awakened a lifelong fascination with the creation of this wonderful drink.\r\n“It is like following an illusion we fell in love with a long time ago leaving us with the realization that when we pursue our dreams the immortality of spirit is found”.",

Chin Music is the perfect brew to enjoy while watching America’s favorite pastime, baseball.\r\n\r\nCOTU uses water that is similar to some of the great lager-brewing areas of Europe. Four different malted barleys are used in the mashing process. In the boil kettle, German Tettnang hops create a modest bitterness, just enough to balance with the malt. A Czech yeast strain is used during fermentation that leaves the beer looking clean and tasting malty. Chin Music then goes through a cold conditioning period(lagering) until the flavors are just right. Naturally carbonated, Chin Music is then filtered to remove any excess yeast.\r\n\r\nThe result is a beautiful and crisp amber lager from COTU.\r\n\r\nLeave the ordinary beer in the bat rack. And swing away with Chin Music.",

Color ranges from deep copper to brown. The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).",

Tartine’s Hungarian/Eastern European-inspired cuisine overflows with creativity and originality. This stems from their dedication to creating everything in-house, the old-fashioned way. This includes smoking peppers and making their own paprika. Nick shared some of his house-made chipotles with us and we fell in love—smokey and sweet with a delicate heat and deep intoxicating aroma—we knew we had to build a beer around them.\r\n\r\nInspired by these chipotles, we combined them with Cherry-wood smoked malt and black and chocolate roasted malts to create a rich, deep beer with just a hint of chipotle heat hiding in the finish. Pair this 9% sipper with BBQ, goulashes and whatever is on special at Bar Tartine.",

Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.",

Sam happened to be at that dinner and got a real kick out of the beer, so we decided to brew a big batch for the pub so everyone else could try it.\r\nThis scaled-up batch has a robust porter base and was brewed with live lobsters, which were added directly to the boil to cook off for the kitchen. Along with the lobsters, just over 6 pounds of dark cocoa powder were added to the whirlpool, along with a basil tea that was added to compliment both the chocolate and lobster.",

      "description": "One of the brightest stars in a city filled with culinary treasures, Christopher Elbow has been handcrafting masterpieces in chocolate for more than ten years. In that time the reputation of his artistic delicacies has spread around the globe. Elbow’s sweets are distinguished by their use of unusual and sometimes surprising flavors and ingredients; in that adventurous spirit we joined forces to bring you a very special Chocolate Ale.\r\n\r\nIn developing this beer, Elbow and Boulevard brewmaster Steven Pauwels sought to harmonize the interplay of chocolate and malt, with each supporting and enhancing, but not overwhelming, the other. Just the right chocolate was essential. Elbow recommended a rare variety from the Dominican Republic, prized for its robust flavor and aroma, and a personal favorite. More than a mere flavoring, the chocolate — in the form of nibs, or crushed, roasted beans – was incorporated into the brewing process itself.",

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.",

Roasted malt astringency and bitterness can be moderately perceived but should not overwhelm the overall character.

Chocolate Indulgence comes with a thick tan head of foam resting on top of the rich onyx-colored liquid. The aroma immediately speaks of dark chocolate and dark malts. The gentle herbal nose of Perle hops compliments the darker notes, making the beer savory to the senses.\r\n\r\nThe taste continues with the intense Belgian dark chocolate gliding across the tongue; starting sweet up front but giving way to rich cocoa flavors at the back. Through it all, a subtle fruitiness from our special Belgian yeast gives the beer brightness otherwise foreign to a beer style normally associated with gray foggy skies.\r\n\r\nLingering chocolate entices the drinker to taste more. Go ahead. Dessert is good for the soul.",
