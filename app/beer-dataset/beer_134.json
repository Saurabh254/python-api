The style can be given more body with milk sugar (lactose) before bottling. Malt sweetness, chocolate, and caramel flavor should dominate the flavor profile and contribute to the aroma. Hops should balance and suppress some of the sweetness without contributing apparent flavor or aroma. The overall impression should be sweet and full-bodied.",

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

It pours to a golden straw colour with a creamy snow white head that laces beautifully. The aroma is fresh and floral with tones of citrus fruit (Cascade hopping) combined with mellow malts and earthy hops. This is a sophisticated beer that offers a rich yet dynamic flavour that is crisp and never harsh, with enough bitterness (18 B.U.) and a very smooth pour to excite your palate with a refreshing and conspicuous hoppiness.",

Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.",

This finish offers a perfectly balanced mix of crisp and smooth refreshing tones that are both complimenting and gratifying. This is a distinctive traditional lager that gently challenges your taste buds and rewards your adventurous spirit with an eminently drinkable beer.",

Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.",

To further separate the Country White from the Wit style (which is commonly brewed with dried orange peels), we used fresh Valencia oranges throughout the brewing process to add a hint of citrus to the beer. And, to maintain a strong local tie, we use 200 lbs of Nebraska organic, rolled white wheat in every batch. After you park the lawnmower, Country White Ale will be waiting for you all summer long…\r\n\r\nHops: Santiam & Glacier\r\n\r\nMalts: Pils, Rolled Wheat, & Victory",

These farmhouse ales are historically crafted with Pilsner, Munich, and a large dose of wheat malt that lends the beer a distinct, Spring-like quality. Biere de Mars are traditionally crafted at the beginning of winter with the farm’s freshest crop of barley, wheat and hops. The farm’s brewers then spend months aging what they consider their finest beer of the year.” Our Courir de Mardi Gras is seasonally brewed and released for all of your pre-Lenten, Mardi Gras celebrations – whether you are chasing plastic beads and doubloons at a parade or a live chicken in a muddy field.",

Photos of The Hoff were plastered throughout the brewery for the collaboration brew, which invoked powerful memories of JC's 'favorite' Hoff photo... one where he is strategically \"covered\" in puppies. After sharing this photo with the Omnipollo crew, everyone immediately agreed this would be name of the Double IPA we were brewing.\r\n \r\nInitially brewed and released as a draft only beer in Sweden, Covered in Puppies has now arrived stateside!  The label design was inspired by Karl & Kevin's favorite artist when they were kids: MC Escher. Karl and Kevin were able to fully realize the inspiration from Escher and meld that with the respective styles of each brewery.  A nose of tropical fruit and bubble gum take the lead with and woody resin undertones. Palate is juicy with flavors of creamy pineapple and freshly baked bread, wrapping it up with a soft -as-a-puppy bitterness.",

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

Esters should be at medium to high levels. Diacetyl should not be evident. Chill haze may be evident. Sulfur-like yeast character should be absent.. No Brettanomyces character should be present. An ale which exhibits Brettanomyces character would be classified as \"American-style Brett Ale.\" A statement by the brewer that could include information such as style being elaborated upon, and other information about the entry with regard to flavor, aroma or appearance, is essential for fair assessment in competitions. Beers with Brettanomyces may be subcategorized under this category.",
