      "description": "Daliesque is made from a grain bill of 60% barley and 40 % wheat. Spontaneously fermented in open fermenters. After fermentation begins, it is transferred into Johannesburg Riesling barrels to ferment and mature. This batch is somewhat cloudy, little to no carbonation and bracingly sour. After aging, the Brett in the beer will balance with its lactic acid and sourness with the malt and barnyard characteristics.",

        "description": "Unblended, naturally and spontaneously fermented lambic is intensely estery, sour, and sometimes, but not necessarily, acetic flavored. Low in carbon dioxide, these hazy beers are brewed with unmalted wheat and malted barley. Sweet malt characters are not perceived. They are very low in hop bitterness. Cloudiness is acceptable. These beers are quite dry and light bodied. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambicstyle\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Vanillin and other wood-derived flavors should not be evident. Historically, traditional lambic is dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar or artificial sweeteners. Sweet versions may be created through addition of sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet. Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.",

Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze.

It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.",

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.",

Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.",

The carbonation balances the moderate sweetness from the malt, resulting in a dry and smooth finish. \r\n\r\nTHE STORY: The Colombian Monks could really cut loose during the annual retreat hosted by Del at his home near Naivasha Lake in Kenya. Smiling ear to ear and with ale in hand, they would dance the night away! You might find you are doing your own little happy dance after a glass of Dancin’ Monks. Drink, dance, repeat.",

      "description": "Dancing Trout Ale is a German Wheat Ale, the filtered version of a true Bavarian Hefeweizen. In Bavaria this beer would be called a Kristall-Weizen (Crystal-Wheat) because of its clarity. Dancing Trout Ale is brewed with malted wheat, pale and carmel malt, and moderately hopped using the best quality hops from Germany. Unlike its British and American counterparts, Dancing Trout Ale is brewed in the Bavarian tradition: aged a minimum of 28 days, versus 7-10 days for the average ale. This means Dancing Trout Ale is mild with no bitter aftertaste! We dedicate this beer to helping preserve Montana’s trout habitat, one beer at a time. \r\n\r\n To truly appreciate Dancing Trout Ale as a year-round member of Bayern Brewing’s line of fine beers, an explanation is in order. This is especially because it is possible that you may already know this beer by one or two different names. \r\n\r\n Back in 1987, this beer was known as Bayern Light Wheat Ale — the filtered version of our original Hefeweizen. In 2002, Light Wheat Ale took on the personality many beer connoisseurs came to know as Trout Slayer Ale. The beer and the name grew in popularity, especially with our outdoor and angling audience. Bayern Brewing celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2007, making it the oldest brewery operating in Montana. At that time, in order to honor our time-tested brew, we decided to change the name and the label image to best reflect Bayern Brewing's environmental company philosophy. In our search for a more appropriate name we kept coming back to Dancing Trout and Montana native artist Monte Dolack created yet another evocative image that was used for the label. Whether as a fishing term or in various spiritual expressions of music and dance, Dancing Trout has become a symbol celebrating the lifestyle embraced by Montana and the values of Bayern Brewing.",

The phenolic and estery aromas and flavors typical of Weissbiers are more subdued in Leichtes Weizen. Hop flavor and aroma are normally absent. The overall flavor profile is less complex than Hefeweizen due to decreased alcohol content. There is less yeasty flavor present. Leichtes Weissbier has diminished mouth feel relative to Hefeweizen, and is a low-bodied beer. No diacetyl should be perceived. The beer may have a broad range of color from pale golden to pale amber.",

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

Old Man’s Ale er med sin stort set fraværende kulsyre og sine varme toner af træ og velmodnet frugt en øl, der skal nydes i fredfyldte omgivelser – gerne foran pejsen fra et stort cognacglas. Old Man’s Ale har ligget fire måneder på calvados fade fra en af Frankrigs mest velrenommerede producenter Domaine Familial Louis Dupont, og træet giver øllets dets bløde vanilletoner, mens amerikansk Chinook humle tilføjer tilstrækkelig bitterhed til at skabe balance overfor den høje maltsødme og den markante og varmende alkohol. Old Man’s Ale er i udpræget grad en øl til de stille og eftertænksomme stunder - en øllets cognac.\r\n\r\nHoldbarhed: 15 år.\r\n\r\nBør nydes ved 16-20 grader C\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish: Forget what you think beer is all about when being warmed by this Old Ale. Forget the lack of carbon dioxide and the warm notes of wood and matured fruit require that this Old Man’s Ale is to be enjoyed in peaceful surroundings – preferably in front of the fireplace served in a big cognac glass. Old Man’s Ale has aged for four months on calvados barrels from one of the most prominent French producers; Domaine Familial Louis Dupont, and the wood grant soft tones of vanilla while the American Chinook hops add sufficient bitterness in order to balance the high malt sweetness and the significant and warming alcohol. Old Man’s Ale is indeed a beer for the quite and thoughtful moments – the cognac of beers.",

Hop aroma should be minimal and flavor can vary from none to medium in character intensity. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas can contribute to the character of this ale. Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character. Competition organizers may choose to distinguish these types of old ale from modern versions.)",
