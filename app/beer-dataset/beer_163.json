        "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

Knocking down all those little Duckpins just made us thirsty for something bigger! So we went back to the brewhouse and doubled down on malts and hops. The result is a double IPA that’s danker than a rental shoe and rolling with ten frames of juicy, resinous hops down a solid lane of malted barley and wheat. When it’s time to bring you’re A game, reach for a Double.",

Ours is brewed with four distinctly American hops: Centennial, Citra, Columbus and Simcoe, all beautifully balanced by five malts and generous additions of local orange blossom honey. An intense sensory experience — the fresh aroma of citrus, pine and grapefruit with the bold taste of hops and sweet honey.\r\n\r\nThis beer was first brewed to celebrate American Craft Beer Week in 2010. The Double IPA style is distinctly American, and so are the flavors of the specific hops used. This beer was an instant hit (Southern Californians do love their hops!) and we plan on brewing it throughout the year whenever our production schedule allows it.",

Our Double IPL brings a free spirit home, with a crisp, clean, hoppy flavor, passionately crafted just for you. Colorado Native Lagers are brewed with 100% Colorado grown ingredients. The majority of the barley used to brew other beers in Colorado comes from out-of-state malt houses and the majority of the hops used to brew other beers in Colorado come from Europe and the Pacific Northwest.

Complexity of alcohols and fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by assertive bitterness and extraordinary alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor are at medium to very high levels. American type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. A caramel and/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",
