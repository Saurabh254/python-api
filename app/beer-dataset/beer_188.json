Pumpkin qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. These may or may not be spiced or flavored with other things. A statement by the brewer explaining the nature of the beer is essential for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with pumpkin, the brewer should also specify the classic style.",

Effervescent and crisp, this seriously delicious elixir tempts the palate with apple (oh so Garden of Eden), pear and a little earthy mustiness. Fallen Angel captivates your senses with its lightness and brightness while its 8% ABV strength breathes fire into your soul, warming you from the inside out.\r\n\r\nAngel-like in appearance, the devil is in its strength.\r\n\r\nWith its introduction in 2006 and its immediate cult following, Fallen Angel is now brewed and released about once a year.",

I then brew a cream ale designed to put some sweetness and body back into the beer, which rounds out the sour apple notes. This combination of ethereal apple flavor grounded in an “everyman’s” beer makes for a festive and potent brew.",

Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.",

This is born and brewed a American Pale Ale (APA).",

What is important, is the revelation. Something new on offer. A delicious hybrid beverage combination the world had never before tried: Horchata Cold Brew Coffee! Can you imagine?\r\n\r\nIt was quite the taste sensation. They were feeling inspired.\r\n\r\n“The similarity between Cold Brew Coffee & Stout is striking” Exclaimed Jeffrey.\r\n\r\n“What if, just what if…!” mused Nigel “We could find out what it takes to make authentic, great tasting, horchata & combine those ingredients with a delicious stout”??\r\n\r\n“Ooooh! Ooooh!” Squealed Jeffrey with excitement “We could use some really interesting specialty malts like rice, wheat & golden oats. That would really make for some interesting flavours! And let’s back up the body with a little sweetness…hmmm…THAT’S IT! We’ll add lactose, also known as milk sugar to give it that creamy satisfying sweetness we experienced with that Horchata Cold Brew. Now if only we knew the key ingredients to a tasty horchata…”.\r\n\r\nThey set about finding out who was behind this wonderful marriage of deliciousness. It was discovered the good folks over at Kafka’s Cafe on Main Street & the Mexican Maestro’s at local favourite Sal Y Limon had got their noggins together to create this Horchata Cold Brew. They were kind enough to share their recipe secrets, even going so far as make a little cold brew to add for a subtle hint of coffee.\r\n\r\nJeffrey & Nigel returned to the brewery, triumphant with an incredible new beer idea.\r\n\r\n“Fantasmagoria” was born. We think it’s gonna be a hit.\r\n\r\n(Also, they all lived happily ever after).",

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.",

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived.

Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.",
