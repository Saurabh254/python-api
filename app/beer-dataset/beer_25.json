Bitters are low alcohol (3 to 4.5% abv) pale ales that are often dry hopped and served on cask. Our take on the style is suitably sessionable at a modest 4% abv, but we wanted to turn it up a notch in the hop department – so instead of using the mellower English hop varieties we blasted it with a blend of Centennial and Chinook in the kettle, followed by a hefty dry hop with more Centennial. The result? A great beer to get your hop fix with and still be able to drive home!",

Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance.

A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived.

      "description": "If you’re looking for another reason to try Pretty Things this summer, we hope a well-stated 7% pale lager might be a good bet too. We hear what you’re saying: “a filtered Pretty Things lager”? Nothing strange about that, we love to brew all sorts of beers!\r\n\r\nThis time we were looking to make the un-lawnmower beer (with an emphisis on the “UN”). Just how do we go about doing that? How about by starting with some of the world’s greatest pilsner malt from Weyermann in Bamberg, Germany? There’s no rice and corn in our darling either – just the best malted barley for purpose in the world. What else? All of the hops used in brewing American Darling come from the Hallertau hop region of Germany. Fermentation uses a blend of three of Europe’s great lager yeasts, low temperature fermentation and lagering, over a period of six weeks. Yes, that’s the UN lawnmower beer.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the process is to filter so that it can be more portable, without sediment to worry about disturbing. Put it in your coolers, your picnic baskets… your saddlebags. Take it to family reunions and pie eating contests, parades, beaches, fancy mustache conventions, hot dog factory tours, monorail excursions, secret basement lairs… wherever good summer fun happens!\r\n\r\nThen fire up the grill, not just once – how about like every day! Get out the horse shoes, kick up your feet and forget that oily red jalopy out back even has a purpose.",

      "description": "Proud to be a micro-beer brewed the “easy way”, with no adjuncts, no beechwood, and no tortuous filtration. If you dissect this beer you won’t find any green apple aromas, what you will find is a clean malt and hop character that easily surpasses your everyday light lager. This crisp, refreshing, sessionable beer is brewed to battle the scorching Mojave Desert heat. At Joseph James the only thing we are looking to “acquire” are loyal drinkers!",

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.
