        "description": "Scotch ales are overwhelmingly malty and full-bodied. Perception of hop bitterness is very low. Hop flavor and aroma are very low or nonexistent. Color ranges from deep copper to brown. The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).",

        "description": "These beers must portray the unique characters imparted by yeasts typically used in fruity and big Belgian-Style ales - These beers are not traditional Belgian styles which are already defined. They are unique beers unto themselves. Notes of banana, berry, apple, sometimes coriander spice-like and/or smoky-phenolic characters should be portrayed with balance of hops and malt character when fermented with such yeast. Hop aroma, flavor and bitterness not usually found in the base style, can be medium to very high and must show the characters of American hop varieties. Color falls in the blonde to amber range. Esters should be at medium to high levels. Diacetyl should not be evident. Chill haze may be evident. Sulfur-like yeast character should be absent.. No Brettanomyces character should be present. An ale which exhibits Brettanomyces character would be classified as \"American-style Brett Ale.\" A statement by the brewer that could include information such as style being elaborated upon, and other information about the entry with regard to flavor, aroma or appearance, is essential for fair assessment in competitions. Beers with Brettanomyces may be subcategorized under this category.",

Garrett had always admired the delicate balance of flavors in Schneider Weisse, while Hans-Peter had long enjoyed the effusive hop character of Brooklyn East India Pale Ale and BLAST! Garrett’s concept for the collaboration was that each brewmaster would brew essentially the same pale, hoppy weissbock in the other’s brewery, but with different hopping to reflect the local hop flavor.\r\n\r\nGarrett traveled to the 400 yr-old Schneider brewery in Kelheim, Germany, to brew Schneider-Brooklyner Hopfen-Weisse. This was dry-hopped with the local Hallertauer Saphir hop variety. A couple months later, Drexler brought his yeast to Brooklyn and brewed Brooklyner-Schneider Hopfen-Weisse, choosing the American Amarillo and Palisade varieties for the dry-hopping. The beer has a full orange color and the aromatics pair the banana and clove notes from the Schneider yeast with the mango and citrus qualities of the hops. The bitterness is robust but balanced, and the beer has a clean, hoppy finish.",

Hopfenmalz was part of the Anniversary Draft Series, a collection of eight single batch, limited release brews which took place over the past two years. Fans were asked to go online and vote for their favorite in the series, with the winner becoming the commemorative beer for the sesquicentennial year. The votes are in, and the fans have spoken. So join us as we raise a glass and celebrate 150 years of brewing history with Schell’s Hopfenmalz! Prosit!\r\n\r\nHopfenmalz incorporates the elegant drinkability of a Pilsner, the bready maltiness of a Vienna Lager, and the hopping of a Pale Ale. The malty backbone is beautifully balanced by a bright, citrusy hop aroma and bitterness. Then we lagered it for an extended period of time to give it a crisp, dry finish.",

Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.",

      "description": "Welcome to another fun Double IPA. This one is called Hopfenpop and will start shipping to accounts on Monday August 3rd.\r\nWe are calling this a “pre-prohibition double IPA”, part of a new series we’re calling “Never Upon a Time”.\r\n“Why?”, you ask? Well, it’s because we did an old-school, big boy cereal mash to give it exceptionally light body (for an 8% abv beer). A cereal mash uses corn grits, which are not really a craft brewing thing. In fact, we couldn’t buy them from any of our regular suppliers, such is their “big beer” stigma. Well, they have their uses! (one of which in this case was clogging up our lauter tun big time… but we’ll come to that). The use of a cereal mash allows us to bring down the color and body of the beer, while keeping the ABV and allowing us to hop the beer “stupidly.”\r\nSo, we present to you a pale yellow, 8% abv, low bodied, refreshing, double IPA. The words refreshing and double IPA don’t ordinarily go together, but we think you will agree they do here.\r\nThe hops are Mosaic and Sorachi Ace. And there’s plenty of them. High aroma, fairly high bitterness.\r\nA good high-summer, hot-as-mars kind of a beer.\r\nThe name, of course, is Germany-inspired, and we might wear our lederhosen to the launch party. Maaaaaaybe.\r\nCheers!",

Because of the extensive dry hopping, there's a floral and citrus hop finish. It's then lightly filtered to maintain the appropriate body and flavor. The beer features a combination of American, English and German malts to balance the large amount of hops. The HopFish also uses three hop varieties at five different times and has been dry-hopped for two weeks with 22lbs of Nugget hops.",

        "description": "Classic English pale ales are golden to copper colored and display earthy, herbal English-variety hop character. Note that \"earthy, herbal English-variety hop character\" is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. Medium to high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma should be evident. This medium-bodied pale ale has low to medium malt flavor and aroma. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to strong. Chill haze may be in evidence only at very cold temperatures. The absence of diacetyl is desirable, though, diacetyl (butterscotch character) is acceptable and characteristic when at very low levels.",
