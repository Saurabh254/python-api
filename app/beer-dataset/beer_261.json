Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style.

Imagine yourself surrounded by mountains of hops, with an aroma so enticing you feel like diving in and rolling around in all that delicious piney, danky goodness. Well that is what our Head Brewer Brannon Radicke did…he dove right in! On the trip to the hop harvest, we got a chance to try a new experimental hop that has yet to be named. It’s just numbered hop #07270. We were intrigued and just had to try it. Thus our Session IPA was born.\n\nHoppy Diver Session IPA was brewed with only two-row pale malt and the experimental #07270 and Mosaic. Full of herbal and citrusy notes, Hoppy Diver has all the hop flavor you’d want from an IPA but with a lower ABV. So pull a seat at the bar, and enjoy this limited-release beer on draft, and imagine yourself in a mountain of hops!",

Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.
