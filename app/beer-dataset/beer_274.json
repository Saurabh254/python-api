Hops should balance and suppress some of the sweetness without contributing apparent flavor or aroma. The overall impression should be sweet and full-bodied.",

In the 1800s, this beer very popular. The beer bryggedes in England and sailed to Russia. In order to withstand the long journey was done beer extra strong compared to the Stout, sold in England. The beer was drained often champagne bottles.\r\n\r\nThe high alcohol content of 8% is to ensure the durability of the black beer. There used unrefined cane sugar from Mauritius as extra flavoring. Most English ales are brewed with unrefined cane sugar. By using unrefined sugar, you get tasting notes from cane sugar in the finished beer. The color is in the bright end of the scale. On the other hand, there is no added caramel color in this Stout!\r\n\r\n The taste of Aarhus Brewery Stout is thick and bold. Although it is a strong beer, it is not the hops that are dominant. This makes it easier to access than many other black beer. There is also a slight sweetness from cane sugar that is balanced with the hops. In time, hop bitterness subside, and the sweetness will dominate.\r\n\r\nThe young Stout will be a good companion to a piece of dark meat or a heavy casserole. It will certainly be obvious to drink for Christmas War or pork roast. Danish Yule developed over centuries, where we always have been drinking beer. Therefore suitable beer is just better to Danish cuisine.\r\n\r\nAarhus Brewery Stout will also be an excellent companion for all cheeses. Try to serve bread with cheese. Bread and Stouten will lift and compliment the cheeses.\r\n\r\nServing temperature of Aarhus Brewery Stout allowed to be about 10 degrees. It does not matter that the further warmed in the glass, it can easily tolerate.\r\n\r\nIn time, hop bitterness removable and sweetness will dominate. In about 2 years, Stout be an exciting companion to a strong chocolate cake!\r\n\r\nSave a box, forget it and enjoy! But do not wait too long. by saving it dark and cool, it is not unlikely that it will keep for years.",

The intense maltiness is balanced with a floral hop flavor and the aroma from Cascade and Golding hops.

The color will range from golden amber to deep brown Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottishstyle light ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style light ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style light ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).",

        "description": "American sour ales can be very light to black or take on the color of added fruits or other ingredients. There is no Brettanomyces character in this style of beer. Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere. If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.",
