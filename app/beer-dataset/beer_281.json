Grilled beef finds a friend in IPA; so does your mom’s buttery fried potatoes.\r\n\r\nHowever, America’s popular potion can sometimes be known for a crisp astringency. Our IPA is fine-tuned with a floral, grassy note and a wild citrus gusto. First sips introduce a fruitful forward bitterness with a dry malt finish. Moderately carbonated and built with a medium body, our pale ale brings a seasoned, natural acridity to many types of savory sustenance and great conversation. From an ocean view to a sensual evening, the IPA here at Bad Water Brewing has plenty of good pairings. Keep it fresh, cold and ready to relish.",

At the Brewery Farm we love to grow hops, after several years of playing in the hops gardens, we found that these farm fresh hops will make outstanding fresh beers. We’ve created 5 unique and classic beers to date, we challenged ourselves to complete the 6th, by carefully combining 4 of our bittering hops (Centennial, Sterling, Galena,Williamette) into a true IPA design - we nailed it. Subtle caramel malt provides enough sweetness to perfectly balance with an UNLEASHED bitterness of 48 B.U., within this bitterness is a citrus tone that moves almost to an orange finish. It’s so good, this is a refreshing IPA (you won’t hear that very often), that’s drinkable and shareable. Make some new friends today.",

      "description": "A WELL-BALANCED, REFRESHING IPA WITH A TOUCH OF THE TROPICS.\r\nWinter weather forecast for Hood River: unseasonably tropical. IPApaya, the latest in our Pub Series, blends locally grown hops with notes of papaya for a vacation in a bottle. \r\n\r\nIPApaya was born out of our interest in the tropical aromas of Northwest hops. Pale and wheat malts along with healthy additions of Equinox and Cascade hops provide the perfect golden base for the addition of papaya. The result is a refreshing IPA with the subtle essence of papaya. Tropical aromas of citrus, passion fruit, and papaya are well complemented by clean malt notes. \r\n\r\nAvailable in 6-packs and on draft from January to April.\r\n\r\nFood pairings; Thai dishes such as Thai salad, pad prik king and tom kha, and Indian dishes such as curry, paneer and samosas. Light fruit-based desserts like Thai sticky rice topped with fresh mango and salted coconut milk. Light blue cheese or a nicely aged triple-creme brie.\r\n\r\nAbout the Pub Series: Like a portal to our pub, seasonal brews only available for a limited time (get ’em while they’re cold) give you a taste of the pints and people that celebrate the Pacific Northwest. Perched high on a hill in Hood River, Oregon, Full Sail overlooks the truly spectacular Columbia River Gorge and has been brewing award-winning, ridiculously tasty craft beer using responsibly sourced, local ingredients since 1987. From our pub to your place – Cheers!",

A minimum 51% of the fermentable carbohydrates must be derived from malted grains. The overall uniqueness of the process, ingredients used and creativity should be considered. Beers such as garden (vegetable), fruit, chocolate, coffee, spice, specialty or other beers that match existing categories should not be entered into this category. Beers not easily matched to existing style categories in a competition would often be entered into this category. Beers that are a combination of other categories (spice, smoke, specialty, porter, etc.) could also be entered into this category. A statement by the brewer explaining the experimental or other nature of the beer is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Generally, a 25-word statement would suffice in explaining the experimental nature of the beer.",

Hop aroma should be minimal and flavor can vary from none to medium in character intensity. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas can contribute to the character of this ale. Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character. Competition organizers may choose to distinguish these types of old ale from modern versions.)",

Wood- and barrel-aged sour ales are classified elsewhere.

Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature.

The historical center of Brussels is built on swamps where this flower used to grow abundantly.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, the Brussels Museum of the Gueuze celebrated its 20th anniversary. The Cantillon brewery decided to make a new spontaneous fermentation beer for this occasion, named after this symbolic flower.\r\n\r\nIt is a completely original beer which, contrary to the other products of the Brewery, is not brewed with 35% of wheat. The Iris, which is only made with malt of the pale ale type (giving a more amber colour to the beer) conserves the typical flavour of the spontaneous fermentation, the complex aromas and the vinous taste.\r\n\r\nThe hopping is different too. Lambic is made with 100% dried hops, for the Iris we use 50% of dried hops and 50% of fresh hops. The latter cause a superb acidity, the former, due to their tannins, enable to conserve the beer while preserving all its qualities.\r\n\r\nAfter two years in the barrel, the Iris undergoes a second fresh hopping two weeks before the bottling. A linen bag, filled with hops, is soaked in the beer for two weeks. This technique, called \"cold hopping\", gives the beer a more intense savour and makes the smell and the taste more bitter.\r\n\r\nIris is brewed only once every season and all the beers come from the same brewing. This is why the beer is dated. The second fermentation is obtained by adding liquor.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is a spontaneous fermentation beer, the Iris is very different from the Lambic. The amber colour and the bitter and slightly caramelized taste make it a complex beer.",
