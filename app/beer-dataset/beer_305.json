Sa bouche, vive et croustillante, s’étire dans une amertume durable qui en fait un rafraîchissement de choix.\r\nLa rivière St-Maurice fut la dernière rivière dravée du Québec. L’opération de nettoyage lancée au milieu des années 90 mit officiellement fin à un siècle de flottaison, redonnant au peuple mauricien et aux gens venus les visiter ce joyau qui leur appartenait.",

        "description": "A classic German Pilsener is very light straw or golden in color and well hopped. Perception of hop bitterness is medium to high. Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.",

So it was that we decided to bottle the first moon, using the same base de The Last moon. Of course a barley wine of this caliber needs a lot of time in the bottle to blend, which is why we begin to let out the bottles after at least 10 months of aging. The result is a less complex de Beer The Last Moon, where you do not feel the influence of the cask and wine which it contained, the oxidation then I just mentioned (while in the other case are exaggerated) but the beer is much more consistent style and gives great satisfaction to lovers of the genre.",

Complexity of alcohols and fruity-ester characters are often high and counterbalanced by assertive bitterness and extraordinary alcohol content. Hop aroma and flavor are at medium to very high levels. American type hops are often used but not necessary for this style. Very low levels of diacetyl may be acceptable. A caramel and/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.",

Aromas may vary tremendously due to fermentation characters contributed by various known and unknown microorganisms. The overall balance should be complex and balanced. Hop aroma very low to high. Usually because of a high degree of attenuation in these beers, malt character is very low to low. If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low. Wild beers are \"spontaneously\" fermented with microorganisms that the brewer has introduced from the ambient air/environment in the vicinity of the brewery in which the beer is brewed. Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.",

The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused.

        "description": "Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are any range of color from pale to dark depending on underlying Belgian style being fruited. Clear to hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. Fruit aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian-, farmhouse-, saison- and/or Brettanomyces-type yeast using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Malt sweetness can vary from not perceived to medium-high levels. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) and if present contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Body is variable with style. Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of fruit characters more so than the addition of fruit itself, within a Belgian beer style. As an example, a fruited Saison exhibiting some Brett character would be appropriately considered as Belgian Fruit Beer; whereas a fruited Brett Beer might more appropriately be considered as Brett Beer. Lambic-Style fruit beers should be entered in the Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic category. Fruited Belgian style beers brewed with additional unusual fermentables should be entered in this category. Fruit beers fermented using German, British or American ale or lager yeast would be more appropriately categorized as American-Style Fruit Beer or as Fruit Wheat Beer. For purposes of competition coconut is defined as a vegetable; beers exhibiting coconut character would be appropriately entered as Field Beer.",

Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.

        "description": "Herb beers use herbs or spices (derived from roots, seeds, fruits, vegetable, flowers, etc.) other than or in addition to hops to create a distinct (ranging from subtle to intense) character, though individual characters of herbs and/or spices used may not always be identifiable. Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.",

      "description": "The La Tentation blends three different kinds of fermentation. It’s a Saison recipe that is first fermented with Dupont yeasts, followed by a second fermentation with Belgian witbier yeast which has spent one year maturing in oak barrels. The final part of the fermentation comes from wild yeasts from an orchard at the foot of the Jura Mountains. The yeasts and bacteria found naturally on the skin of native Reinette Blanche apples, coupled with months of barrel aging gives the La Tentation a very refreshing acidity. This acidity is balanced by apple fruitiness and hop bitterness, which is characteristic of old-style Saison. Let yourself be tented !",

The aroma of the Malbec is very noticable, lots of oak flavours from medium toast, and vanilla and almond from high toast barrels, floral aromas from Acasia and obviously the beer aromas from the quadrupel. Very robust and rich in tannins, which warrants a bit of extra maturation in the bottle to let the complexity increase and the flavour become rounder. While the red wine influence is noticable, the wood has the dominant note. A must for everyone who likes heavy beer and/or wine with lots of wood flavour and aroma. 55% Used Malbec barrels 20% New French oak, medium toast 20% New French oak, high toast 5% Acacia wood.",

This flavor is remarkable and clearly different from those of previous batches. Peat and burnt are more present, while wood and wood tannins are less obvious to spot. But the warming effect of the full, robust flavor the whiskey barrels passed on to our already beautiful Quadrupel, makes this batch maybe even the most tasty brewed to date.",

      "description": "Characteristic of Batch 34 is the dark amber-brown colour and the relatively fragile head. The most important ingredient of this batch is a red wine from Cahors, department Lot, that has matured well over 2.5 years in barriques of French Malbec. The grapes used for Malbec wines are full of colour and powerful tannins, which make for the distinctive rich taste and dark colour.\r\n\r\nThe first impression of the scent of this Oak Aged is complex and reminiscent of ripe black fruit, vanilla, cacao and tobacco.  \r\n\r\nContrary to Batch 31, for which Malbec wine barrel are used as well, the wood flavour in Batch 34 is enhanced by the relatively large amount of new wood that is used. In combination with the lengthy maturing period, this results in a very high level of wood tannins for an intense Oak Aged experience. \r\n\r\nMaturation has significantly reduced the bitterness, which makes the beer sweeter and softer than the normal Quadrupel.\r\n\r\nThe aftertaste brings out the taste of red wine, giving a pleasant, slightly sour finish.",

Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused.

A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.

        "description": "A wood- or barrel-aged beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood. This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.",

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.",

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. The brewer must explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port/ whiskey/ wine/ sherry/ other), base beer style or achieved character. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging.",

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",
