A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation.

They are unique beers unto themselves. Notes of banana, berry, apple, sometimes coriander spice-like and/or smoky-phenolic characters should be portrayed with balance of hops and malt character when fermented with such yeast. Hop aroma, flavor and bitterness not usually found in the base style, can be medium to very high and must show the characters of American hop varieties. Dark color falls in the deep amber/brown to black range. Roasted malts or barley may have a range of character from subtle to robust, and should be reflected in the overall character and balance of the beer. Esters should be at medium to high levels. Diacetyl should not be evident. Chill haze may be evident. Sulfurlike yeast character should be absent. No Brettanomyces character should be present. An ale which exhibits Brettanomyces character would be classified as \"American-style Brett Ale.\"A statement by the brewer that could include information such as style being elaborated upon, and other information about the entry with regard to flavor, aroma or appearance, is essential for fair assessment in competitions. Beers with Brettanomyces may be subcategorized under this category",

In response, we created Lost Continent in 2009 and updated it for 2010. This year's version is brewed with well over three pounds of hops per barrel in the kettle and another half-pound per barrel of “dry hops” in two additions during conditioning. A revised fermentation program has produced a more traditional Double IPA flavor profile--drier, less malty, more hoppy.\r\n\r\nWe use only American Pacific Northwest hops. Galena hops are added early in the boil for smooth, balanced bitterness. We add Columbus, Centennial and Amarillo later in the boil for flavor, and Columbus, Centennial and Simcoe in the whirlpool for aroma.\r\n\r\nFor even more aroma, we dry-hop with Summit, Columbus, Amarillo and Cascade hops in the conditioning tank, and dry-hop again right before bottling with whole-flower Cascade hops. The result is fruity, floral and complex, with notews of tangerine zest and fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice.\r\n\r\nIdaho 2-Row Brewers’ Malt and German CaraHell and Vienna malts give this ale its lovely pale copper hue, with flavors of orange marmalade and dried apricots, supported by a strong backbone of hoppy bitterness.",

English Crystal malts give this IPA a rich golden-orange hue and a subtle, yet firm, malt background. Bright and citrusy with grapefruit notes, Lost Gold features an abundance of American hops that always mark the spot. Don’t worry, however, you won’t have to hunt for this treasured favorite. It’s available year round all over Texas.",

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.",

        "description": "Pumpkin beers are any beers using pumpkins (Cucurbito pepo) as an adjunct in either mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation, providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, qualities. Pumpkin qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. These may or may not be spiced or flavored with other things. A statement by the brewer explaining the nature of the beer is essential for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with pumpkin, the brewer should also specify the classic style.",

The second fermentation is not caused by addition of young lambic but of sweet liquor. The standard Cantillon Gueuze is a blend of 1,2, and 3-year-olds. The inclusion of the younger lambic (which still has some unfermented sugars in it) sparks a refermentation in the bottle that gives Gueuze its famous champagne-like spritziness. The simple idea behind the special Lou Pepe blend is that it should have much more of the taste of old lambic, which is of course much harder, drier, more sour, and more complex than the young stuff. (Though 3-year-olds are generally more complex than 2-year-olds, it's not necessarily so; the 2-year-olds used in this instance have as much character as most 3-year-olds.) This being Gueuze, it has to be spritzy, so the brewery opted for the same method used in conditioning champagne: everyday refined sugar is dissolved in water and added to cause a refermentation. The sugar ferments out completely, so there is no residual sweetness, which Jean-Pierre famously detests.",
