Originally brewed in the 14th century in the town of Einbeck, Germany, it quickly became a favorite style in Bavaria. One of the Bavarian brewers actually enticed a brewer from the North to move to Bavaria where the style was popularized. Maibock is a great beer to accompany robust flavors. The rich flavor from the dark-roasted caramel malt complements the moderate level of bitterness to create a perfect balance. Maibock is available seasonally from February through April.",

A caramel and/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably.

        "description": "Sweet stouts, also referred to as cream stouts, have less roasted bitter flavor and a full-bodied mouthfeel. The style can be given more body with milk sugar (lactose) before bottling. Malt sweetness, chocolate, and caramel flavor should dominate the flavor profile and contribute to the aroma. Hops should balance and suppress some of the sweetness without contributing apparent flavor or aroma. The overall impression should be sweet and full-bodied.",

It’s completed with a light colored malt backbone to stay in balance. Kick back and enjoy!\r\n\r\nThis beer has been dubbed a summer IPA. Big powerful combinations of many different kinds of hops give a big hop profile. We added flaked barley to the beer to make for the smooth body and lighter summer-style IPA.

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

We just gained a new brewery here in Brooklyn. A few months ago, we busted through the brewhouse wall into another building and expanded our fermentation cellars.Now we’ve just finished installing a big shiny new set of German brewhouse equipment. Over the coming years, we’re going to brew you a lot of fun new beers on this baby.\r\nFirst, though, it’s time to rev this whole thing up and get it humming. The first beer out of our new brewhouse is Brooklyn Main Engine Start, a burnishedgold ale in the rare “Abbey Singel” style, reminiscent of the un-filtered beers that Trappist monks make for themselves. It’s dry and biscuity on the palate, with a lilt of spicy Belgian yeast character and a snappy hop bite. Judicious dry hopping with Slovenian Aurora hops lends an appetizing herbal note. It’s tasty enough to stick with for the whole evening, and at about 6% ABV, it won’t have you tripping over snow banks after just one.\r\nWe know it’s winter and you might have been expecting something heavy and dark, but right now we’re just not in a heavy and dark mood. In fact, we’re feeling pretty cheerful, and we want to celebrate with a bunch of our friends and a few pints of beer. If you’re in the neighborhood, stop by during our tour hours and see the new brewery. If you’ve seen the brewery before, you’ll be amazed what we’ve done with the place. It’s cold outside – stay a while. We’re going for Main Engine Start.",

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.",

      "description": "Berliner Weisse style sour ale aged on Maine wild blueberries and cinnamon sticks\r\n\r\nWith late-season access to some Maine wild blueberries (thanks Boston Organics!), we captured a bit of “The Way Life Should Be” in this rich, full-flavored winter sour. Mainer Weisse has a nose of ripe berry and cinnamon spice, warming hints of the holidays. It sips fruity, tart, and bold, finishing with a sweet and surely-sour bite. It is blue, and it is beautiful.",
