      "description": "Ten different malts and six different hops (Ahtanum, Cluster, and Spalt to name a few) combine to create this full-flavored, small beer. Even Keel features a silky malt backbone and a bright hop flavor and aroma that come from the late kettle additions and dry hopping with 1.5 pounds per barrel. Even more layers of flavor are created with fermentation being done by two strains of yeast. This session ale is herbaceous with additional citrus aromas of lemon and grapefruit. The orange to copper hue draws you in and the low alcohol volume keeps you coming back for more.",

The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.",

Horsey, leathery or earthy aromas contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Hop aroma is not perceived. Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low. They typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

If acidity is present it is usually in the form of lactic, acetic and other organic acids naturally developed with acidified malt in the mash or in fermentation by the use of various microorganisms including certain bacteria and yeasts. Acidic character can be a complex balance of several types of acid and characteristics of age. The evolution of natural acidity develops balanced complexity. Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Wood vessels may be used during the fermentation and aging process, but wood-derived flavors such as vanillin must not be present. In darker versions, roasted malt, caramel-like and chocolate-like characters should be subtle in both flavor and aroma. American sour may have evident full range of hop aroma and hop bitterness with a full range of body. Estery and fruity-ester characters are evident, sometimes moderate and sometimes intense, yet balanced. Diacetyl and sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should not be perceived. Chill haze, bacteria and yeast-induced haze are allowable at low to medium levels at any temperature. Fruited American-Style Sour Ales will exhibit fruit flavors in harmonious balance with other characters.",

Fruit aromas ranging from subtle to intense should be evident, and should not be overpowered by hop aromas. Belgian-Style Fruit Beers are fermented with traditional Belgian-, farmhouse-, saison- and/or Brettanomyces-type yeast using fruit or fruit extracts as an adjunct in either the mash, kettle, primary or secondary fermentation providing obvious (ranging from subtle to intense), yet harmonious, fruit qualities. Malt sweetness can vary from not perceived to medium-high levels. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) and if present contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Body is variable with style. Classifying these beers is complex, with exemplary versions depending on the exhibition of fruit characters more so than the addition of fruit itself, within a Belgian beer style. As an example, a fruited Saison exhibiting some Brett character would be appropriately considered as Belgian Fruit Beer; whereas a fruited Brett Beer might more appropriately be considered as Brett Beer. Lambic-Style fruit beers should be entered in the Belgian-Style Fruit Lambic category. Fruited Belgian style beers brewed with additional unusual fermentables should be entered in this category. Fruit beers fermented using German, British or American ale or lager yeast would be more appropriately categorized as American-Style Fruit Beer or as Fruit Wheat Beer. For purposes of competition coconut is defined as a vegetable; beers exhibiting coconut character would be appropriately entered as Field Beer.",

This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors.

Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer.

We “pre-hop” this beer by throwing hops in the brew kettle well before it boils, which firms up the bitterness.  We continue adding hops throughout the process for layers of hop flavor, finishing with a massive dry hop addition injected through out patented HOPZOOKA®. In the end, despite using a massive 2.75 pounds of hops per barrel, Maniacal remains a tropical beauty.",

The style is characterized by fruity, floral and citrus-like American-variety hop character producing medium to medium-high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Note that the \"traditional\" style of this beer has its origins with certain floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American hop varietals. One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",

Yeast-generated  fruity esters, including banana, are also common, but not necessary. These pale/light-colored ales may finish sweet, though any sweet finish should be light. The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.",

Beechwood smoked malt contributes an upfront roastiness while charred manzanita branches add hints of perfume and a slightly tannic woody finish.\r\n\r\nManzanita is an imaginative take on the classic German rauchbier, combining traditional ingredients with inspiration from the Northern California wilderness. An assertive, multi-layered smoke aroma -- courtesy of beechwood-smoked malts and charred manzanita branches -- gives way to a light-bodied structure and a surprisingly delicate balance of flavors: nutty, herbal, sweet and savory. A beer for a campfire on a crisp fall night.",
