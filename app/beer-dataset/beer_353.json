Hop aroma should be minimal and flavor can vary from none to medium in character intensity. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas can contribute to the character of this ale. Bitterness should be minimal but evident and balanced with malt and/or caramel-like sweetness. Alcohol types can be varied and complex. A distinctive quality of these ales is that they undergo an aging process (often for years) on their yeast either in bulk storage or through conditioning in the bottle, which contributes to a rich, wine-like and often sweet oxidation character. Complex estery characters may also emerge. Some very low diacetyl character may be evident and acceptable. Wood aged characters such as vanillin and other woody characters are acceptable. Horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces organisms and acidity may be present but should be at low levels and balanced with other flavors Residual flavors that come from liquids previously aged in a barrel such as bourbon or sherry should not be present. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. (This style may often be split into two categories, strong and very strong. Brettanomyces organisms and acidic characters reflect historical character. Competition organizers may choose to distinguish these types of old ale from modern versions.)",

Beers that are a combination of other categories (spice, smoke, specialty, porter, etc.) could also be entered into this category. A statement by the brewer explaining the experimental or other nature of the beer is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Generally, a 25-word statement would suffice in explaining the experimental nature of the beer.",

If there are exceptions that are malty, the overall balance of complexity of other characters should be in harmony. Hop flavor very low to high. Hop bitterness is perceived at varying levels depending on the overall balance, but usually perceived as very low to low.

Wild beers may not be fermented with any cultured strains of yeast or bacteria. Wild beer may or may not be perceived as acidic. It may include a wildly variable spectrum of flavors and aromas derived from the wild microorganisms with which it was fermented. The overall balance of flavors, aromas, appearance and body is an important factor in assessing these beers. Body is very low to medium. Spontaneously fermented beers with fruit, spice or other ingredients would be appropriately entered as Wild Beer. For purposes of competition, entries which could be appropriately entered in an existing classic or traditional category such as Belgian-Style Lambic, Gueuze, Fruit Lambic, etc. should be entered in that category and not entered as a Wild Beer.",

      "description": "To showcase the glory of the Mosaic hop, our brewers built a simple malt bill of two-row malted barley and a touch of malted wheat—then added loads of prized Mosaic hops. This minimalist approach lets the incredible tropical citrus hop aromas and sweet pine hop flavors come through with clarity and focus. On the finish, the clean bitterness is balanced by just enough malt character to ensure that the next sip is a foregone conclusion.",

We minimized the specialty malts in this brew to allow the star of the show, the hops, specifically Mosaic, to be showcased properly. Using Warrior as our primary bittering hop and additions of Mosaic and Zythos in the brewkettle and whirlpool we created a crisp intense bitterness and layers of earthy and herbal flavors. Finally, we dry hopped this unique IPA with Mosaic once again to lock in and enhance the aromas of tropical fruit, citrus and fresh pine.",

      "description": "This is not your average IPA.  From the incredible nose, to the amazing finish, this IPA is one that both session drinkers and beer nerds alike will love.\r\n﻿\r\nWe’re full on board the hopwagon with this big American-style IPA.  However, it is not designed to blow your head off with overpowering hop bitterness.  Instead, Mosaic IPA is an extremely well-balanced brew that showcases its unique hop aroma and flavor.\r\n​\r\nThis beer gets its name from a new hop variety named “Mosaic,” which is predominantly where the immense, raw hop aroma and flavor is derived.  Mosaic IPA has a noticeable malt backbone to help soften the high level of hop bitterness and flavor, while keeping the body fairly light.\r\n﻿\r\nThe word \"Mosaic\" is also representative of the diverse range of individuals that make up our community.  It's perfect in every way!",

This multitude of flavor sinks deep into the taste buds, briefly clinging to the roof of the mouth to enliven the palate adding zest Flowery citrus notes dominate by mid-serving masterfully integrating with the patina of bitterness that finishes with a 5.5 ABV snap. The palate cleansing hop character comes courtesy of Mosaic and Equanot hop varieties from the Pacific Northwest. As the pale, tawny and orangey-gold body warms an intriguing volume of effervescence drives the mouthfeel and momentum to its lively citrus refreshing conclusion.",

      "description": "In April 2013 we inked a deal with ArtPrize that made us the official brewery of the competition for the next five years. The premier leadership sponsorship deal included offering our beer at all official ArtPrize events, signage, promotion, merchandise, specialized glassware and other items. It also included permission for us to use the ArtPrize identity marks (logo and graphics) on any co-packaged items, including beer. We plan to release a new beer for each year of our five-year partnership with ArtPrize under the name “Artist Series”. This is year two. Last year’s release was Inspired Artist Black IPA.\r\n\r\n“Making a unique beer in honor of ArtPrize has become a fun challenge for our brewers,” said Dave Engbers, our co-founder and vice president of brand and education. “This year’s release just fell into place. Ninkasi—a stained glass ArtPrize submission that showed in our taproom last year—became a permanent part of our taproom when we purchased it last year. We knew right away that it would make a perfect label for Mosaic Promise, a beautifully simple beer that we had been experimenting with for some time.”\r\n\r\nMosaic Promise showcases a single malt—Golden Promise—and a single hop—Mosaic. The traditional barley’s depth of flavor and the versatility of the hops’ bittering, flavor and aroma characteristics are the strong pillars that comprise the structure of this clean, rich, golden beer. We can brew complex beers with the best of them, but we recognize that there’s also beauty in simplicity. The beer clocks in at 5.5% ABV and 50 IBUs.\r\n\r\nProceeds from the sale of Mosaic Promise will support the future programming of the ArtPrize organization. ArtPrize is an international art competition, open to any artist and decided by public vote. Its mission is to promote critical dialogue and collaboration through new, creative ideas among a large and diverse population of people. As an innovator in redefining what beer can be, we believe that experimentation is central to the human experience—whether one experiments with grains and hops or colored glass and light—and that sharing one’s creation with the public is a brave act worth celebrating.\r\n\r\n“Founders is an iconic brand producing a sublime range of exquisite beers in our own Grand Rapids,” said Christian Gaines, executive director of ArtPrize. “We’re honored and elated to count Founders as the ArtPrize Official Brewery and to include Mosaic Promise as the latest special release beer—one that’s emblematic of our strong partnership and shared commitment to art, artists and community.”\r\n\r\nMore than 400,000 people are expected to attend ArtPrize 2014.\r\n\r\nWe also partnered with ArtPrize to launch ArtPrize on Tap, the newest ArtClub membership perk. From the patios of the Centennial Room, our private second-floor entertainment space, ArtPrize on Tap offers ArtClub members the opportunity to connect year-round and stay on the ArtPrize insider track, while enjoying Founders food and beer. We will premiere Mosaic Promise at the August installment of ArtPrize on Tap. Held on the third Wednesday of every month, ArtPrize on Tap is free for ArtClub members, and friends of ArtPrize and Founders can join for $10. To learn more, go to artprize.org/artclub.\r\n\r\nMosaic Promise will be available for a limited time starting on Sunday, September 14, across our Michigan, Wisconsin, metro NYC and Chicagoland distribution footprint. It will be released in our taproom on draft and in bottles starting on Tuesday, September 16. There will be an event in our taproom featuring the artists and introducing the beer from 4:30-6:30pm that day. One-of-a-kind Mosaic Promise posters will be given away, while supplies last. Mosaic Promise will also be featured at official ArtPrize events.\r\n\r\nThis year marks the sixth edition of ArtPrize, which will take place Sept. 24–Oct. 12, 2014. Our taproom will be a venue for the sixth year running.",

India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.
