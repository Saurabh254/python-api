      "description": "ALASKANA series:\r\n Eight beers will debut in 2014 but this series is designed as an ongoing experience to represent “life in Alaska.” Additional beers will be created in this series and our favorites will be re-produced. You can help us decide!\r\n\r\n“As in all areas of the world, Alaska has its own vernacular — a unique array of terms that describe life in the Great Land. Inspired by these quirky terms, Midnight Sun is presenting some favorites in the form of beer. So whether you live in Alaska or Outside, let your taste buds interpret our language via your glass.\r\n\r\nMUDFLATS:\r\n Mudflats are coastal wetlands that form when mud and silt are brought in by seas, oceans and tributaries. When the tide comes in, water mixes with the mud and silt, creating the muddy quicksand that occurs in mudflats. Tourists are warned to not walk out on the mudflats because getting stuck knee-deep when the cold water tide is coming back in is no way to end your vacation-slash-life. Our Belgian-style Quadrupel is sludgy deliciousness and, yes, dangerous. Kick off your Xtra Tufs and stay on the couch.",

Often characterized by a mousse-like dense, sometimes amber head will top off a properly poured and served quad. Complex fruity aroma and flavor emerge reminiscent of raisins, dates, figs, grapes, plums often accompanied with a hint of winy character. Caramel, dark sugar and malty sweet flavors and aromas can be intense, not cloying, while complementing fruitiness. Though well attenuated it usually has a full, creamy body. Hop characters do not dominate; low to low-medium bitterness is perceived. Perception of alcohol can be extreme. Clove-like phenolic flavor and aroma should not be evident. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Diacetyl and DMS should not be perceived. Well balanced with savoring/sipping drinkability. Oxidative character if evident in aged Quads should be mild and pleasant.",

Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels.

Then, Mudshark gains hop bitterness in the kettle, including a late addition imparting a gentle zest. The result of all this is a happy salute to your inner chocolate lover.\r\n\r\nSo smooth and creamy, Mudshark ranks among the favorites of a special class of aficionados known for their appreciation of fine beer: the Mighty Fish Brewers.

The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused.

        "description": "Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color. There may be quite a variety of characters within this style. Generally: They are light to medium in body. Malt aroma is low to medium-low. Esters are medium to high in  aroma, while, complex alcohols, herbs, spices, low Brettanomyces character and even clove and smoke-like phenolics may or may not be evident in the overall balanced beer. Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.",

A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

A statement by the brewer explaining the nature of the beer is essential for fair assessment in competitions.

The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.",
