Clocking in at 6.8% ABV and a low 35 IBUs, the unfiltered IPA provides a burst of fruited hop aroma and leaves drinkers wanting another sip. In comparison to West Coast style IPAs which have prominent hop bitterness and a light, dry mouthfeel, New England IPA’s are generally known for a juicy, luscious mouthfeel and opaque, hazy appearance - and are best enjoyed fresh.",

There is no special significance to the name other than that (no pagan rituals here!). But what is significant about the name is that we release a cask on every new moon for the year following the release of a new vintage. Everybody seems to make such a big deal about the full moon, so we decided to give the new moon a little attention",

The style is characterized by fruity, floral and citrus-like American-variety hop character producing medium to medium-high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Note that the \"traditional\" style of this beer has its origins with certain floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American hop varietals. One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",

We’ve taken advantage of cutting edge Cryo Hop technology in order to dial up the flavor without maxing out the booziness. \r\n\r\nCryo Hops are farm-fresh hops finished with a special cryogenic process that concentrates the resins and aromatic oils of the hop flower and filters out vegetal cone material. The result is a deeply layered palate of citrus and floral flavor with restrained bitterness. New SOP’s subtle underlying malt character supports its complex hoppiness without getting in the way of the flavor.\r\n\r\nThis beer pours a beautifully clear golden color with a brilliant white sudsy head. New SOP is clean, smooth, and almost dangerously drinkable with a brisk, dry finish.\r\n\r\nNotes of tangerine, grapefruit, apricot, rose petals, and papaya give this delicious DIPA depth and intricate flavor.",

Typically the ale is consumed from a 12 fl oz Wellington glass. This allows the drinker to regularly top-up the beer and thereby maintain a frothy \"head.\" In the United States, it is also sold in standard 12 fl oz (355 ml) bottles. In April 2010, Heineken USA introduced the Wellington glass, branded as the \"Geordie Schooner,\" for Newcastle Brown Ale consumers in America. The pint glass features a nucleated base.",

Hop flavor or aroma should not be perceived. Scottish heavy ale will have a medium degree of malty, caramel-like, soft and chewy character in flavor and mouthfeel. It has medium body, and fruity esters are very low, if evident. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).",

The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze.
