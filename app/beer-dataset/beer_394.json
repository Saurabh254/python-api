Bold and full flavored, this beer embodies the aggressive brewing practices that the US craft brewers have been known for. Here at NoDa Brewing, there's hops in our logo so you know we've been wanting to brew up an Imperial IPA since the beginning. Bold Pacific Northwestern hops combine with New Zealand hop varieties to give us a full Pacific hop assault in the form of Nelson Sauvin, Pacific Jade, Centennial, Columbus, Warrior, and Amarillo.  We then fortify the beer with delicious local Orange Blossom Honey. Don't worry... it won't attract bears, just new friends eager to share a bottle with you!",

In fact, to the contrary, Pacific Schwarzbock has a nice velvety body with lots of warm mouth feel. The black malts come through just enough to provide a subtle hint of coffee notes.",

The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.",

Fruit qualities should not be overpowered by hop character. If a fruit (such as juniper berry) has an herbal or spice quality, it is more appropriate to consider it in the herb and spice beers category. Acidic bacterial (not wild yeast) fermentation characters may be evident (but not necessary) they would contribute to acidity and enhance fruity balance. Clear or hazy beer is acceptable in appearance. A statement by the brewer explaining what fruits are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with fruit, the brewer should also specify the classic style.",

We’ve chosen German hops for aroma, and rounded out the recipe with a blend of American and German malts.\r\n\r\nWhile it is very much like a pilsner, our Pale Ale is fermented at ale temperatures, giving it a subdued fruitiness—a perfect compliment to the crispness of the wheat and maltiness of the Munich malt. If you like a lighter brew but also like the complexity of craft beers, then our Pale Ale is for you.",
