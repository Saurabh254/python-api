After fermentation, it is cold conditioned and dry-hopped in lagering tanks for maximum taste and quality. It is naturally carbonated in the bottle or keg using a German process called “krausening”, where a small amount of fresh fermenting wort is added. This produces a delicate carbonation and superior flavor. From the Mash Tun to store shelves is a 30 day process.",

These beers are highly attenuated and have a perceptively deceiving high alcoholic character-being light to medium bodied rather than full bodied. The intensity of malt character should be low to medium, often surviving along with a complex fruitiness. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived.

It’s our house pale ale and a beer that we are proud to brew and delighted to drink.\r\n\r\nWe’re also proud and delighted that Pale Fire is a favourite in our nearest pub; The Chesham Arms. This pub was saved from the brink by a group of local residents who fought to get it listed as one of the UK’s first Assets of Community Value in October 2012. The campaign went on doggedly for 929 days with the Chesham finally reopening it’s doors as a pub again in Summer 2015. Read more here http://www.savethechesham.org/\r\n\r\nPale Fire stole it’s name from a novel in the form of a poem, whose title was lifted from a Shakespeare play…. The cultural plundering doesn’t stop with the name of the beer. The label too is an homage to the great Californian poolscapes painted by David Hockney. Heat haze, pine trees, swimming pool all you need now is a beer. Perfect.",

Noble-type hop aroma and flavor are moderate and quite obvious. It is a well-attenuated, medium-light bodied beer, but a malty residual sweetness can be perceived in aroma and flavor. Very low levels of sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) character are below most beer drinkers' taste thresholds and are usually not detectable except to the trained or sensitive palate. Other fermentation or hop related sulfur compounds, when perceived at low levels, may be characteristic of this style. Fruity esters and diacetyl should not be perceived. There should be no chill haze. Its head should be dense and rich.",

        "description": "Rye beers can be made using either ale or lager yeast. It should be brewed with at least 20 percent rye malt, and low to medium perception of hop bitterness. Hop aroma and flavor can be low to medium-high. These are often versions of classic styles that contain noticeable rye character in balance with other qualities of the beer. A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale. A statement by the brewer indicating if the beer is based on a classic style is essential for accurate judging.",
