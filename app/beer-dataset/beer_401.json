      "description": "When looking to brew with our good friends from Against the Grain, we looked to brew an American classic but with a decidedly Yorkshire twist; and like our previous collaborations together, with a touch of Southern hospitality! The result? This delicious Anglo-American inspired stout! We drew inspiration from everyone’s favourite welcome to the day; breakfast! We like it hearty with a good stack of pancakes, smoky bacon and maple syrup to kick start the day the proper way! Using a portion of smoked wheat to get the taste buds salivating, healthy additions of strong coffee to get us going and maple to add a sweet finish to send us off about our business; this beer is just as good later in the day to keep the party going.",

So the mouthfeel is still soft and silky smooth but this time with just a touch more intensity of malt flavour.

      "description": "Edge Brewing based in Barcelona we believe were the first international brewery we visited for a collaborative brew and it’s taken this long to finally get them over to the UK for a return! We decided to try out a new IPA style that we’d been hearing about – Brut IPA. Enzymes break down all of the complex wort sugars into easily fermentable glucose, resulting in a bone-dry IPA backed up by high, sparkling carbonation. Another avenue we’d been keen to go down for a while was brewing with grapes alongside one of our favourite but hard to source hops, Nelson Sauvin. This felt like the perfect opportunity. We fermented this IPA with a Kolsch yeast strain – super clean and highly attenuative; then added 20L of white grape juice per barrel and double dry-hopped with Nelson Sauvin. The hop line up was then backed up with Halllertau Blanc, Citra BBC and Ekuanot Cryo pellets for a soft but crisp, resinous IPA full of juicy grape, elderflower, apricot and lime zest flavours.",

Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.",

The phenolic and estery aromas and flavors typical of Weissbiers are more subdued in Leichtes Weizen. Hop flavor and aroma are normally absent. The overall flavor profile is less complex than Hefeweizen due to decreased alcohol content. There is less yeasty flavor present. Leichtes Weissbier has diminished mouth feel relative to Hefeweizen, and is a low-bodied beer. No diacetyl should be perceived. The beer may have a broad range of color from pale golden to pale amber.",

The overall flavor profile is less complex than Hefeweizen due to decreased alcohol content. There is less yeasty flavor present. Leichtes Weissbier has diminished mouth feel relative to Hefeweizen, and is a low-bodied beer. No diacetyl should be perceived. The beer may have a broad range of color from pale golden to pale amber.",

They host the annual Paw Paw festival and helped make the Paw Paw the native state fruit of Ohio. With all this celebration, we think you’ll understand why each drop of this mead is a statement of the richness and diversity that Ohio is capable of. It bursts a spectrum of tastes - earth, citrus, melon, honey, and spice. Paw Paw blushes a light pink with a semi-sweet finish. Intriguing on it’s own – and an entirely new experience with food.

These flavored lambic beers may be very dry or mildly sweet and range from a dry to a full-bodied mouthfeel. Characteristic horsey, goaty, leathery and phenolic character evolved from Brettanomyces yeast is often present at moderate levels. Vanillin and other woody flavors should not be evident. Versions of this beer made outside of the Brussels area of Belgium cannot be true lambics. These versions are said to be \"lambic-style\" and may be made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. Historically, traditional lambics are dry and completely attenuated, exhibiting no residual sweetness either from malt, sugar, fruit or artificial sweeteners. Some versions often have a degree of sweetness, contributed by fruit sugars, other sugars or artificial sweeteners. Competition organizers may choose to subcategorize this style into A) Traditional and B) Sweet.  Artificial sweeteners are sometimes used in some brands.",

Named for the Greek goddess of retribution, Pax Nemesis was brewed in 2009 and was available in 22 oz bottles that like any big beer, age well. Look for vintage bottles at a beer retailer near you, but remember, BEHAVE. She may be watching.",

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character, but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel and/or wood used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties) and/or barrel (whiskey, port, sherry, wine, etc.) was used in the process. The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.",
