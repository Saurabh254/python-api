      "description": "The Baltika #3 Classic beer was first launched in 1992 and has been traditionally the most popular beer among Russian consumers since the mid-90ies due to its invariably high quality.\r\n\r\nThe year of 2004 witnessed a \"new birth\" of the Baltika #3: the glass bottle received a new shape and label, which was accompanied by the first canning of the brand. In May 2006 the Baltika #3 was produced in an innovative package: a premium 1 liter PET-package that looks practically the same as the half-liter glass bottle. In 2007 the Baltika #3 bottle received an embossed lettering. At the same time the brand was produced in a one-liter aluminum can that was new for the market. In April 2008 a 1.5-liter PET bottle with a \"football\" design was produced for the Baltika #3, especially for the Russian Football Championship. The PET-glass material has high protective qualities and keeps the most popular Russian beer fresh for a longer period.\r\n\r\nDue to the high demand the production of this popular brand keeps growing. By the results of the 2008, the volume of sales amounted +7,5% (Business Analytica) , which allows the brand to remain a certain leader in the medium-price segment. The highest distribution level of Baltika Company for food products (98%) makes the Baltika №3 available for buyers all over the country.\r\n\r\nToday the Classic beer is exported to over 40 countries around the world, including Germany, Japan, Great Britain, the United Arab Emirates, Greece, France, and Ireland.\r\n\r\nFor ten years running the Baltika #3 Classic has received the prestigious Russian \"Commodity of the Year\" prize in the field of consumer goods. The prize is awarded to the most popular mass consumption products available in the assortment of retail shops. Since the time the prize was established the Baltika #3 Classic has been the unconditional leader in the \"beer\" category.\r\n\r\nThis beer brand is also annually declared \"The Most People’s Brand\" by the results of tasting at the Moscow Beer Festival, the largest beer festival in Russia. In 2008 the Baltika #3 won a silver medal at the Superior Taste Award contest in Brussels established by the International Taste and Quality Institute. The Baltika Three has altogether over 30 awards of international and national contests.\r\n\r\nThe Baltika Three is produced under a license in Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan.",

      "description": "Baltika №4 Original is one of the oldest brands of Baltika Breweries produced since April 1994. The very name stresses the distinctive character of this brand as its recipe has no analogues either among Russian or world brands. Baltika №4 is a dark drink produced with rye malt, which adds bread flavor and light bitterness to the taste. The Original sort is now steadily popular and has dedicated lovers throughout Russia.\r\nBaltika #4 is traditionally produced only at St. Petersburg brewery. From this place it is taken all over Russia and exported to almost 30 countries of the world.\r\n\r\nBaltika #4 has won a number of top prizes of international professional contests. In September 2004 Baltika #4 was among the 50 top brands of the world by the results of the annual International Beer Challenge Contest. All the brands participating in the contest are divided into 12 classes and are strictly assessed by their flavor and package by the leading experts in brewing. The jury includes both consumers and specialists in marketing and packaging.\r\n\r\nTwo times running, in 2007 and 2008, Baltika #4 won the silver medals of the Australian International Beer Awards Contest in the category of Lager Packaged.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Baltika #4 Original brought the Company the Gold Medal of the European Beer Star Awards Contest in the category of Red and Amber Beer. This is the top award of one of the most prestigious contests of the world brewing. The contest was organized by the Association of Private Breweries of Germany and the Association of Independent Breweries of Europe. One of the conditions of the participation is strict compliance with the traditional laws of European brewing. The jury of 65 experts in brewing from 16 countries evaluated the available brands in 40 categories. The samples were traditionally tasted by \"blind testing,\" which guaranteed unbiased evaluation.",

        "description": "A wood- or barrel-aged sour beer is any lager, ale or hybrid beer, either a traditional style or a unique experimental beer that has been aged for a period of time in a wooden barrel or in contact with wood and has developed a bacterial induced natural acidity. This beer is aged in wood with the intention of introducing the micro flora present in the wood. Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients.  Usually bacteria and \"wild\" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.",

      "description": "Cooperstown Brewing Company's latest offering is an American Amber ale in honor of one of America's greatest sports legends, Babe Ruth. It is a perfect balance of bold hops and smooth malts to create a drinkable, but complex ale. The Bambino Amber is light copper in color and pours with a clean white head. Crystal and Melanoidin malts provide the defining malt sweetness with a hint of caramel in the finish. These are matched by American Cascade and Willamette hops with a moderate bitterness and a floral and citrusy flavor and aroma.",

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.",

Is that what the New England IPA will become? Who knows? What we do know is this: Our Bandwagon New England IPA is loaded up with immense dry hop additions including Amarillo, Crystal, CTZ, El Dorado, Nugget, and Waimea hops. Hop aroma like you wouldn't believe! Juicy citrus character for days. The addition of torrified wheat and naked oats provide the deep haze that is a signature character of the New England IPA style.

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.",

        "description": "Scotch ales are overwhelmingly malty and full-bodied. Perception of hop bitterness is very low. Hop flavor and aroma are very low or nonexistent. Color ranges from deep copper to brown. The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).",

Honey is added instead of sugar. The fair trade variety is sold under the Maya label. The Barbãr is golden in colour with a generous head. The mead aroma immediately reveals its origin. After shaking, the taste becomes more complex with a hint of milk, citrus fruit (candied lemon peel) and spices (coriander, ginger).\r\nThe first sip is broad but the acidity strengthens the beer and gives it a lovely balance and freshness. The aftertaste is smooth and refined, spicy like liquorice root and slightly sweet. In an age where everything is done at top speed, now and again it is good to return to one's roots, to this drink that our ancestors referred to as the \"warriors' rest\".",
