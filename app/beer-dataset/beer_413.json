        "description": "American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content. The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

      "description": "Juicy, expressive, and playful on the tongue, Pippins reveals why cider was North America’s favourite drink before Prohibition. This aromatic off-dry cider is as robust as our pioneers and the Pippin apple trees that flourished on our frontier. Raise a glass of Sea Cider and let our apples tease your senses!\r\n\r\nThe Story: Pippins is a tribute to the pioneers that homesteaded on Vancouver Island and across North America. A “pippin” is an apple tree that grew from an errant seed (unlike most apple trees, which are propagated by grafting). Pippins cider reflects the story of how apple varieties developed during North America’s pioneering age, when many of the Old World varieties failed to thrive, but their seeds produced a generation of new varieties. The Yellow Newton Pippin is one such apple, and the main varietal in Sea Cider’s Pippins. This apple is high in both acid and sugar (important features in traditional North American cider varieties).  Pippins cider is made in the New England pre-Prohibition style, which means sharply acidic, but balanced with subtle sweetness, and high in alcohol thanks to chapitalization. Fermentation is undertaken at cool temperatures to preserve fruity aromas and to maintain the acidity. A dosage of organic cane sugar is added during fermentation to raise the level of alcohol (this was traditionally important to improve the shelf life of cider during the pioneering days).\r\n\r\nTasting Notes:\r\nAppearance: Effervescent, warm straw in colour, clear, bright.\r\nAromas, flavours: Citrus, apple, pear, lemongrass, pineapple, confectionary.\r\nAcid/sweetness: Intense acidity, balanced by slight residual sweetness.\r\nMouthfeel: Crisp, sharp to the tongue.",

These beers are highly attenuated and have a perceptively deceiving high alcoholic character-being light to medium bodied rather than full bodied.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category.

American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong.

Malt flavor and aroma are medium. This is a light-medium to medium-bodied beer. Sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS), fruity esters and American hop-derived citrus flavors or aromas should not be perceived. Diacetyl is not acceptable. There should be no chill haze.

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category.

        "description": "A true smooth cold-fermented and cold lagered beer, brewed with lager yeast. Black to very deep ruby/garnet in color. Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.",
