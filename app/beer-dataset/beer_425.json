PUMPKICK is brewed with plenty of pumpkin juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice, but it’s the cranberries and touch of lemongrass that send your tastebuds sailing.",

Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation.

Recipes calling for the use of pumpkins in beer date back to early colonial times, when brewers sought to extend their supply of costly imported malt with locally grown ingredients, such as squash and “pompions.”\r\n\r\nIn that spirit, we brew our ale with the addition of pumpkin to the mash, along with traditional spices to create a delicious American original.\r\n\r\nAvailable in sixpacks and on draft from mid-August through October.",

Alaskan brewers have put a new spin on the Pumpkin Porter that has come out the past two years, and produced a smooth brown ale-based recipe that combines holiday spices and organicPumpkin Ale_Product Shot-pressrelease pumpkin for a perfect autumn pour.\r\n\r\n“In Juneau,we’re acutely aware of the transition from Summer to Fall, and we like to make the absolute best of the season by bringing as much flavor as possible to our Fall Seasonal beer,” said Brent Kesey, one of the lead brewers on this beer. “So, even though the days are getting a little shorter, we have something to be happy about! We think folks are going to really like the holiday flavor and drinkability of this new beer.”\r\n\r\nFollowing in the footsteps of the highly regarded Alaskan Pumpkin Porter, this Pumpkin Ale has the holiday spices of nutmeg, cinnamon, clove and brown sugar plus a pinch of Alaskan’s famous alder-smoked malt, with a base of a lighter brown ale featuring Vienna malt and Goldings hops.\r\n\r\n“We were going for a warming spicy brew with a rich welcoming flavor that reminds me of the great flavors and aromas of pumpkin pie,” said Kesey. “Up here in Alaska we fight the cold and dark by getting together with family and friends. This time of year is when the strong community we have here is so important, and this beer is perfect for keeping those great get-togethers going strong.”\r\n\r\nThis very quaffable Fall Seasonal beer will be perfect with any holiday fare or sweeter breads, but can also work well with salted meats or pretzels to let that spicy sweetness compliment the savory saltiness. Alaskan Pumpkin Ale will be available in most markets by mid-August, as Alaskan Summer Ale begins to leave the shelves, and will run until November when Winter Ale ships out.",

      "description": "When the nights grow cold and the moon hangs low, we carve out a space for Pumpkin Ale’s great return. Artfully brewed with all natural pumpkins, Pumpkin Ale features a slightly sweet finish from additions of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger that deliver a well-balanced brew reminiscent of grandma’s pumpkin pie.\r\n\r\nThe perfect drink for the fall season, pumpkin beers date back to colonial America when malted barley was sparse and pumpkins grew in abundance. We continue the tradition with this seasonal treat that’s ripe for the pickin’.",

Thanksgiving is perhaps the best of holidays, for it is a time for sharing and enriching our lives. To honor Fall we offer our deep mahogany hued Pumpkin Ale, bursting with a robust roasted malt flavor. To this mélange we add copious amounts of pumpkin and embellish that further with nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger. This would have been ideal, but perfection is our preference and so we diligently add cocoa nibs as the beer conditions and intensifies the depth of flavor. This melds magnificently with the pumpkin and spice. And as a fitting finale we gently introduce hops to compliment this complex potion and the result is a finish that is clean and brilliant. Perfect for Fall and the approaching holiday season.",

Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.

      "description": "A pumpkin ale that bucks the trend.\r\nSome might think we’re out of our gourd for making a pumpkin ale, but our Pumpkin Down is not like the others.  The caramel and toffee maltiness of our Piper Down Scottish ale is the perfect backdrop for a boatload of roasted pumpkin. Just before bottling, we add a subtle amount of spice to complement, but not overwhelm, the earthy flavor. It was a smash at the brewery, and we think you’ll agree.",
