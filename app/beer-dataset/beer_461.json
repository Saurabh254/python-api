      "description": "Born from Brad and Gordon’s backyard test batches in Fort Collins, the Saison that sits before you has since evolved into a GABF gold-medal winning beer. This beer is heavily reliant on flavors and aromas generated by our house yeast that showcase our care in every aspect of the brewing process. Our flagship Saison pours with a beautiful orange hue and effervescence. Aromas of passion fruit, tangerine and black pepper first hit the nose before flavors of orange, lemon verbena, clove and pepper lead to a dry and lingering bitterness that awaits another sip.",

Our saison takes that idea and gives it a little twist.  We use pink peppercorns and a mountain of late addition hops to add a spicy, fruity, citrus aroma and flavor.  Add in the four types of malt and the French yeast and you have a beer with intricate flavors and aromas all the way through.  Do some yard work and pretend you are a Belgian-French farmer enjoying the fruits of your labor brought forth in this remarkable, refreshing brew.",

This includes a crisp malt profile, rustic floral and spice notes and lively carbonation. Our rendition expresses further depth and character from its fermentation and maturation in a large oak foeder. Saison Ardennes will continue to pleasantly evolve in the bottle, thanks to the presence of wild yeast added for bottle conditioning.",

They added “extreme” amounts of hops and malt to have a beer that wouldn’t spoil in the hot summer months.  The hops were usually very low in Alpha Acid content so the beer was not overly bitter.  It was considered a strong beer for the time even though it topped out at 4% ABV.\r\n\r\nMalts: Pilsner, Wheat, and White Wheat\r\nHops: Nobel Hops – Tettnang & Hallertau",

        "description": "Beers in this category are golden to deep amber in color. There may be quite a variety of characters within this style. Generally: They are light to medium in body. Malt aroma is low to medium-low. Esters are medium to high in  aroma, while, complex alcohols, herbs, spices, low Brettanomyces character and even clove and smoke-like phenolics may or may not be evident in the overall balanced beer. Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.",

      "description": "This beer is collaboration between Dogfish Head, Stone Brewing Co. (Escondido, CA) and Victory Brewing Company (Downingtown, PA).\r\nThe idea for this beer germinated way back in 2003 when the three guys (Sam from Dogfish, Greg from Stone and Bill from Victory) formed the BUFF alliance (Brewers United for Freedom of Flavor) - a noble endeavor with the goal to highlight the passion and camaraderie of the American craft brew movement.\r\nSo, BUFF didn't really do anything (beyond talk a lot of talk) until 2010 when the three brewers finally got together to jointly brew at beer at the Stone Brewery. Saison du BUFF was first brewed at Stone and then replicated at each of the other two breweries.\r\nSaison du BUFF is a Saison brewed with parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme. The beer is brewed three times, once at each brewery using the same recipe.",
