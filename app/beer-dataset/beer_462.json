      "description": "Saison du Sept Mers (Saison 'of 7 Seas') is brewed to emulate the classic and very traditional style of Belgian and French Farmhouse Ales. We employ an authentic French Saison yeast strain that imparts a distinctly spicy, rustic, slightly \"wild\" character. The beer features Washington State grown malted White Wheat, Canadian Rye malt, and conventional malted barley which combine to create a refreshingly dry, bready, and slightly peppery malt flavor profile. Lightly hopped with a rare hop variety called 'Sorachi Ace', a woodsy, lemony note is present in the aroma. Saison du Sept Mers is refreshing, complex, and full of subtle rustic charm and nuance.",

This increasingly rare specialty originated before the age of refrigeration as a beer to be brewed in winter for summer drinking. The style required a beer sturdy enough to age in the bottle but refreshing enough to be enjoyed in warm weather. Saison Dupont fits this description perfectly. It has a big, fruity boquet, and dense head. The taste start fruity but ends dry and very clean with a light refreshing body.",

With age, this beer will dry out and will become more complex with rustic notes of leather and earth from the contribution of a wild yeast strain. Being a Saison, Saison Rue is ambiguous unto itself as it is a different beer when fresh and when aged. We hope you enjoy it in all of its incarnations.",

At an approachable 4.5% alcohol, the quaffability of this beer is uncompromising.\r\nSpecial thanks to David and Barbara from Village Garden for supplying the fresh local lemongrass for Saison Rustica.",

Traditionally it was a refresher for tired and thirsty farm labourers.  \r\n\r\nSaison Zest is a modern interpretation, a stronger full flavoured brew. Orange of hue with a big rocky head, aged for two months in the bottle. We've chosen a simple grain bill that showcases Gladfield's  superb malts and added Orange Zest.\r\n\r\nPaired with floral and citrusy hops, our saison yeast imparts massive character and a dry finish. We believe Zest will refresh and sustain the farm worker or office shirker. Enjoy in moderation, it's stronger than it seems!\r\n\r\nUnfiltered and unpasteurised in the traditional manner, for full flavour.",

Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.",

Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.

Dark ebony, the nose is marked by roasted aromas recalling barley coffee, cacao beans and ash with a scent of caramel. It has a malty palate with creamy oats and hints of smoked flavor.\r\n“To the traveler who will never reach his destination, to all those who don’t need reassurance to feel right”.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAlthough its recipe has dramatically changed with time, Sally Brown is the evolution of a type of Oatmeal Stout I used to homebrew. If A.F.O. is fully characterized by its hops, Sally Brown stands out for the use of 11 different types of malt including un-malted cereals such as oat flakes and roasted barley. Two years of investigation in the fascinating world of roasting resulted in the creation of a smooth, complex and balanced, drinkable beer. Its name comes from a Laurel Aitken’s song, one of Jamaica’s Ska forefathers, which was later covered by Bad Manners. In December of 2007, Bad Manner played a show in a venue close to Parma. I showed up during sound check to gift them a case of Sally Brown. They liked it so much they were drinking it on stage and while playing the song “Sally Brown” the lead singer said: “Sally Brown beer, the best!” .Those words filled me with incredible pride and satisfaction. That night was truly memorable.",

Dry stouts achieve a dry-roasted character through the use of roasted barley. The emphasis of coffee-like roasted barley and a moderate degree of roasted malt aromas define much of the character. Some slight acidity may be perceived but is not necessary. European hop aroma and flavor should be low or not perceived. Dry stouts have medium-light to medium body. Fruity esters are minimal and overshadowed by malt, high hop bitterness, and roasted barley character. Diacetyl (butterscotch) should be very low or not perceived. Head retention and rich character should be part of its visual character.",

A minimum 51% of the fermentable carbohydrates must be derived from malted grains. The overall uniqueness of the process, ingredients used and creativity should be considered. Beers such as garden (vegetable), fruit, chocolate, coffee, spice, specialty or other beers that match existing categories should not be entered into this category. Beers not easily matched to existing style categories in a competition would often be entered into this category. Beers that are a combination of other categories (spice, smoke, specialty, porter, etc.) could also be entered into this category. A statement by the brewer explaining the experimental or other nature of the beer is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Generally, a 25-word statement would suffice in explaining the experimental nature of the beer.",
