The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops.

The inspiration for Sawyer's Triple came from namesake Sawyer Benjamin Sherwood, the 8 year-old son of Stone brewer Bill Sherwood and his wife Janis. Over a period of four years, we had the distinct pleasure of getting to know Sawyer via his visits to the brewery or at the occasional backyard BBQ. An engaging and athletic kid if you ever knew one! In early 2003 Sawyer was diagnosed with Adrenoleukodystrophy — also known as ALD — a rare neuro-degenerative disease. At the time of the original creation of this beer and writing of this label in August 2003, Sawyer was in a fight for his life.\r\n\r\nIt felt like a crushing blow when we lost Sawyer in September 2003, only days before the initial release of Sawyer's Triple. The outpouring of support from family, the community, and fans of Stone Brewing brought comfort and solace to such a great degree that it simply cannot be expressed in words. When you enjoy this brew, we encourage you to lift a glass to the noble fight in all of us. When your own fight is overwhelming, remember to seek help. And when you are able to, offer help to others. On Sawyer's behalf, and for all who need assistance with their own fight, we thank you for yours...",

The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.",

Effective July 1, 2012, Senate Bill 604 gives commercial breweries in Virginia the right to sell glasses of beer on-site. For more information on Senate Bill 604 and what it means for Virginia breweries, click here. In the case of the beers released with this name, the \"SB\" stands for \"session beer\" referring to ales or lagers of a milder alcohol content (typically lower than 4.0% ABV). The brewers who spent weeks lobbying on behalf of SB 604 with senators and delegates at Virginia's General Assembly plan to release different variations of SB 604 beers that will be session beers only available for consumption on site at their respective breweries. The \"Special Bitter\" version of this beer offered by Hardywood is very sessionable, at 3.8% ABV. A moderate caramel malt character and some fruity notes provide plenty of complexity and flavor to this beer, which beautifully complements citrusy, high alpha American aroma hops. Dry-hopped with slightly peppery horizon hops, this beer displays the high degree of balance that has become a signature of Hardywood's beers. A relatively dry finish keeps this beer both refreshing and enticing.",

The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.",

This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong.

Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.",

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character but wood aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. The brewer must explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port/ whiskey/ wine/ sherry/ other), base beer style or achieved character. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging.",

He named the faithful pooch, Seaman, but a early transcription error of his journal dubbed the dog Scannon (we prefer this name). Scannon accompanied the Expedition for its duration, even though over 200 other dogs were eaten as dinner during the journey. Scannon survived a vicious beaver attack in 1805, in which the rodent’s incisors sliced an artery in his leg. He was also stolen by Native Americans on one occasion and retrieved.\r\n\r\nThe Beer:\r\nThe Scannon Stout is an oatmeal stout that is both strong and approachable. With its dark color, the Scannon Stout has a nose of roasted notes and flavors of chocolate and roast. There is a subtle, residual sweetness due to the flaked oatmeal. This additional grain also lends a smooth, silky mouthfeel that has to be experienced.",

If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.",

Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.",

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.",
