        "description": "Scotch ales are overwhelmingly malty and full-bodied. Perception of hop bitterness is very low. Hop flavor and aroma are very low or nonexistent. Color ranges from deep copper to brown. The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).",

Scottish Style Ale is our interpretation of the robust brews native to Scotland. Generous quantities of Pale malt along with Munich and Caramalts give this ale a deep and complex profile. Scottish Style Ale is just a shade darker than our Bitter, with a rich, slightly sweet first impression on the palate that rounds out to a satisfying maltiness and a medium-dry hop finish. At 6.3% ABV it's hearty but not overwhelming. Sure to please the Braveheart in all of us.",

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).",

A tribute to both the popular ale style of the time (porter) and his humble island beginnings (coconut), this beer’s name credits Hamilton’s wandering father.\r\nWarm and sweet aromas rise slowly from this hardworking porter with a deep tawny red color and a thin veil of off-white bubbles. Notes of coconut, vanilla, and sweet crystal malts present a complex flavor profile and hold your palate in check with a slight warming sensation. Coconut aromas linger through the finish and remain momentarily sticky on the tongue. Heavier in body and in ABV, this beer will hold up to the coldest winter days and give hints of warmer times where sand, rather than snow, dominates the landscape.",

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.

Scratch #121 represents our take on the Wheat Bock, an amped-up wheat beer that has been “lagered,” or fermented and conditioned at low temperatures. This process gives the beer a smooth crispness, ultimately enhancing its overall texture and mouthfeel. Traditionally, Wheat Bocks are thicker, stronger, and often darker than typical wheat beers, yet they still maintain some the refreshing characteristics that most wheat beers exhibit. Chewy and robust, Scratch #121 elicits hints of lightly toasted grains, vanilla, and fresh baked bread. There’s also plenty of residual sweetness to balance out the 8.2% ABV. This beer will thaw you from the inside out and leave you feeling all warm and tingly!",

      "description": "The origins of this intriguing beer style stretch back to the early 16th century, yet it has only begun to gain popularity following its recent resurgence among American craft beer enthusiasts. Developed in the German town of Goslar, Gose is a top-fermented wheat beer punctuated by a refreshing citrusy tartness and a hint of salt. The salty component complements another key ingredient of the style – coriander. Also known as “cilantro,” this potent spice introduces the zesty lemon-like citrus flavor for which the beer is recognized. We could stop right there, but we decided to explore the style a bit further. Our chef has created a refreshing strawberry rhubarb syrup that adds a hint of sweetness to this tart summer treat. At just 4.0% ABV, you can sit outside all day enjoying this refreshing blast of mouth-puckering joy.",
