        "description": "This style can be either pale or dark (golden to dark brown in color) and has a high starting gravity and alcohol content. The malty sweetness of a Weizenbock is balanced with a clove-like phenolic and fruity-estery banana element to produce a wellrounded aroma and flavor. As is true with all German wheat beers, hop bitterness is low and carbonation is high. Hop flavor and aroma are absent. It has a medium to full body. If dark, a mild roast malt character should emerge in flavor and to a lesser degree in the aroma. If this is served with yeast the beer may be appropriately very cloudy. No diacetyl should be perceived.",

        "description": "These ales and lagers are very low in alcohol and historically in Belgium enjoyed with meals by both adults and children. Pale to very dark brown in color. Additions of caramel coloring are sometimes employed to adjust color. They are light bodied with relatively low carbonation with limited aftertaste. The mouth feel is light to moderate, though higher than one might anticipate, usually because of unfermented sugars/malt sugars. Malted barley, wheat and rye may be used as well as unmalted wheat, rye, oats and corn. A mild malt character could be evident. Aroma/Flavor hops are most commonly used to employ a flavor balance that is only low in bitterness. Traditional versions do not use artificial sweeteners nor are they excessively sweet. More modern versions of this beer incorporate sweeteners such as sugar and saccharine added post fermentation to sweeten the palate and add to a perception of smoothness. Spices (such as orange and lemon peel, as well as coriander) may be added in barely perceptible amounts, but this is not common. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may choose to break out subcategories of Traditional and Modern.",

San Francisco Baykeeper, a local nonprofit, works nonstop to keep it that way. Only Baykeeper confronts polluters and stops harmful actions with their unique expertise in law, science, advocacy, and field investigations, helping achieve decades of legal and policy victories for a cleaner Bay.\r\n\r\nTo celebrate their accomplishments and 30th anniversary, we’re introducing a collaboration beer that’s as fierce as Baykeeper’s commitment to preserving our Bay. Baykeeper IPA is a bright and delicious San Francisco-style IPA, overflowing with juicy and fruit-forward hop layers that finish crisp and dry.\r\n\r\nTeeming with lime, orange zest and papaya aromas, Baykeeper IPA has a slightly spicy, yet slightly sweet taste that finishes with a delicate bitterness. Mosaic, Cascade and Amarillo Cryo hops were used to amplify the fruity and piney hop aromatics in this slightly hazy brew. Anchor takes a balanced approach to the bitterness while ramping up the hop intensity in Baykeeper IPA, making it a tasty San Francisco-style IPA.\r\n\r\nBecause this brew is a celebration of the Bay, Anchor turned to its neighbor across the Bay for some of the malt used in Baykeeper IPA. Based in Alameda, Admiral Maltings makes small-batch, hand-crafted, organic malts produced using tried-and-true malting techniques. For Baykeeper IPA, Anchor used Admiral Gallagher’s Best from the local maltster. In addition, Anchor used 2-Row Pale, Acidulated Malt, Golden Naked Oats, and Toasted Rice, combining to create an exceptional malt profile. The beer pours a deep golden color with a creamy, fluffy head.\r\n\r\nWatercolor artist Jenna Rainey hand-painted the label on Baykeeper IPA, which features Baykeeper’s patrol boat charging through the water underneath the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. Since 1989, Baykeeper’s patrol boat has regularly monitored the San Francisco Bay, the treasure of the Bay Area, to identify and investigate pollution. From there, Baykeeper strategically uses advocacy, public education and legal action to secure smart solutions that stops pollution and restores water quality so that native wildlife and recreational sport can continue to flourish.",

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer.

Bayliner Weisse is our take on the traditional German Berliner Weisse style. Over 700 breweries in Germany used to make this beer and by the 19th century it was their most popular style of beer. By the late 20th century only two breweries in Berlin still produce these beers. This particular style is an unfiltered, sour wheat beer that comes in at about 3.6% alc/vol. It is a nice sessionable beer that can be enjoyed anytime of the year. Traditionally served with woodruff or raspberry syrup but it is most enjoyable when served on it's own.",

The Dark is a dark coloured but light tasting sessionable product that can be enjoyed over and over again year-round. A local favourite, Bays Dark is a very drinkable beer that’s hard to put down. Bays Dark finishes smooth with its chocolate malt addition and lacks the heavy component in many other darker beers because of its pilsener malt.",

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

Color ranges from deep copper to brown. The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).",

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category.

Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories.

Malt sweetness is not perceived to very low. They typically contain malted barley and unmalted wheat, with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop flavor is not perceived. Hop bitterness is not perceived. A wide variety of herbal, spice, floral or fruity flavors other than found in traditional Leipzig-Style Gose, are present in harmony with the overall flavor profile. Salt (table salt) character is traditional in low amounts, but may vary from absent to present in Contemporary Gose. Horsey, leathery or earthy flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Contemporary Gose may be fermented with pure beer yeast strains, or with yeast mixed with bacteria. Contemporary Gose may be spontaneously fermented, similarly to Belgian-style gueuze/lambic beers, and should exhibit complexity of acidic, flavor and aroma contributed by introduction of wild yeast and bacteria into the fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh and carbonated. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas sought while maintaining a balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal. Body is low to medium-low.",

Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable.
