Malt aroma is low to medium-low. Esters are medium to high in  aroma, while, complex alcohols, herbs, spices, low Brettanomyces character and even clove and smoke-like phenolics may or may not be evident in the overall balanced beer. Hop aroma and flavor may be at low to medium levels. Malt flavor is low but provides foundation for the overall balance. Hop bitterness is moderate to moderately assertive. Herb and/or spice flavors, including black pepper-like notes, may or may not be evident. Fruitiness from fermentation is generally in character. A balanced small amount of sour or acidic flavors is acceptable when in balance with other components. Earthy, cellar-like, musty aromas are okay. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Chill or slight yeast haze is okay. Often bottle conditioned with some yeast character and high carbonation. French & Belgian-Style Saison may have Brettanomyces characters that are slightly acidity, fruity, horsey, goaty and/or leather-like.",

These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level.

      "description": "When Martha and I began thinking about what type of beer to brew next for PRETTY THINGS, there was no discussion.  In fact we’ve had it figured out for years.  We both had our hearts set on brewing the sort of beer we loved so much in Yorkshire.\r\nMany people know that Martha and I love Theakston’s Old Peculier, at least the cask version.  But Robinson’s Old Tom is high on our list as well.  Now that Samuel Smith has released Yorkshire Stingo that makes three.  At the brewery where I worked in Yorkshire we made a unique beer called “Morocco Ale”  that is quite similar as well.\r\n\r\nObviously PRETTY THINGS isn’t all about simple replication.  As a rule we don’t do beer “styles” straight up, as it doesn’t leave any room for creativity.  Instead we take our inspiration from great beers as a starting point.\r\n\r\n“Rustic Dark Ale”, is about as apt a descriptor as we could come up with for Saint Botolph’s Town (we almost used “New World Stingo” but decided to save that for a future beer).  This ale is formulated with the malts of Thomas Fawcett & Sons of Yorkshire, England as its base.  When I was brewing in Yorkshire I visited this magnificent maltings many times, seeing crystal and roasted malts still made by hand. On brew day their crystal malt gave an amazing golden raisin-like aroma in the kettle.  Fantastic!\r\n\r\nAs we did in Jack D’Or, we used a small amount of Malted Oats, but cut it this time with Torrefied Wheat.  We “chaptalized” using four different types of sugar in very small doses for both flavour AND colour.\r\n\r\nSBT is fermented with two yeast strains for a unique rustic finish.  But it’s in the yeast strains where this beer really departs from the typical: one is a German ale strain, the other is a common English strain.  Why?  Because it’s about the flavour, not just ticking the “style” boxes.\r\n\r\nIn the end we have an ale of 5.9% abv with a big malty, almost smokey Black Malt character, a bitter attack from Fuggle hops, a rich barleymalt finish, some dried coconut hints and an old ale acidity around the edges.  We’ve even timed its tan head, standing proud for ten minutes!\r\n\r\nThe name “Saint Botolph’s Town” is in tribute to our great home in America: Boston.  The original Boston in Lincolnshire, England is an abbreviation of “Botolph’s Town” or “Botolph’s Stone”. When we were back in Yorkshire recently, we found a churchyard where St. Botolph spoke in the year 675; a ‘stump’ (broken old cross) marks the spot.  Saint Botolph is a 7th century saint from England whose feast day is June 17th.  Perhaps a great day to save a bottle or two for!",

The flavors of this beer meld together to create a full-bodied “little piece of heaven”. Our most decorated beer and now the most decorated brown porter in the history of the Great American Beer Festival! \r\n\r\nPorter was wildly popular back in the 1700s in England and was considered the “working man’s beer”. At one point porter accounted for 80% of the beer sold in England. Everybody brewed a porter. When Arthur Guinness was running his brewery, he was brewing porter.\r\nMedals:\r\n2013 Silver medal – Great American Beer Festival \r\n2010 Silver medal – Great American Beer Festival\r\n2009 Gold medal – Great American Beer Festival\r\n2008 Bronze medal - World Beer Cup\r\n2007 Bronze medal - Great American Beer Festival\r\n2006 Silver medal - Great American Beer Festival\r\n2004 Silver medal - Great American Beer Festival\r\n1999 Bronze medal - Great American Beer Festival\r\n1996 Bronze medal - Great American Beer Festival\r\n1996 Gold medal - World Beer Cup\r\n\r\nTasting notes:\r\nAppearance: Deep garnet red color with creamy tan head\r\nAroma: Hints of dark chocolate, roasted malt and burnt toffee  \r\nTaste: Roasted malt with notes of bittersweet chocolate, raisins and smoky coffee-like character.\r\nMouth feel: Medium-full\r\nFinish: Smooth and well balance.\r\nOverall: This beer is chock full of complex flavors yet is round and well balanced. The late beer author, Michael Jackson says of St. Charles Porter, “… has a firm body and offers the sensation of biting into a praline filled with cream. The richness rounds into bitter chocolate. The beer is smooth, sociable, and dry enough in the finish to demand another round.”",

      "description": "This full-bodied dark brew was inspired by the billows of smoke rising from the steamboats of yesteryear on the St. Croix River. A style dating back to the founding of America, this brew is made with six varieties of malt and a combination of American and British Hops to balance the big malty flavor. Smooth, rich, chocolate malts accented with generous portions of roasted barley and a touch of hearty oatmeal make for a brew to enjoy around the fire with family and friends. Inspire conversation or moments of introspection. St. Croix Cream Stout is truly an American Original.",

Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.",

In my dreams, let me my true love see.”\r\n\r\nCopper in colour, St. Luke’s Verse Gruit Ale offers up an aromatic herb-and-spice bouquet of lavender accented by thyme and rosemary. This is a flavourful, balanced beer that is highly nuanced but very approachable. Gruits are beers made with herbs, spices and other botanicals, and St. Luke’s Verse was first brewed in 2014 for International Gruit Day Feb. 1.\r\nHistory & Style\r\n\r\nCenturies ago it would have seemed odd to consider using only one herb to spice beer. Dozens of plants, such as bog myrtle, yarrow, heather, and juniper were commonly used in ancient brewing. These beers were known as Gruit or Grut (German for herb), and a brewers’ spice blend was a proprietary and carefully guarded secret. After the Reinheitsgebot (Bavarian Purity Act of 1516) ordered that only hops be used to spice beer, the Bavarian style of brewing took hold in most of Europe, and the gruit gradually faded into obscurity. Luckily, some craft breweries have rediscovered this ancient form of brewing. Craft brewing is all about discovery and experimentation, and gruits are one of the best examples of this pioneering spirit!",

Under hopping often, but not always, allows the spice or herb to contribute to the flavor profile. Positive evaluations are significantly based on perceived balance of flavors. Note: Chili-flavored beers that emphasize heat rather than chili flavor should be entered as a \"spiced\" beer.  A statement by the brewer explaining what herbs or spices are used is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. Specifying a style upon which the beer is based may help evaluation. If this beer is a classic style with an herb or spice, the brewer should specify the classic style. If no Chocolate or Coffee category exists in a competition, then chocolate and coffee beers should be entered in this category.",

The beer is characteristically medium and clean in body with an equalizing hop/malt balance and a perception of medium to medium high hop bitterness. Traditional Belgian Tripels are often well attenuated. Brewing sugar may be used to lighten the perception of body. Its sweetness will come from very pale malts. There should not be character from any roasted or dark malts. Low hop flavor is acceptable. Alcohol strength and flavor should be perceived as evident. Head retention is dense and mousse-like. Chill haze is acceptable at low serving temperatures. Traditional Tripels are bottle conditioned, may exhibit slight yeast haze but the yeast should not be intentionally roused. Oxidative character if evident in aged Tripels should be mild and pleasant.",

These beers are highly attenuated and have a perceptively deceiving high alcoholic character-being light to medium bodied rather than full bodied. The intensity of malt character should be low to medium, often surviving along with a complex fruitiness. Very little or no diacetyl is perceived. Herbs and spices are sometimes used to delicately flavor these strong ales. Low levels of phenolic spiciness from yeast byproducts may also be perceived.

Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.",

      "description": "There's nothing better than Bayern's unfiltered Hefeweizen. This Bavarian Hefeweizen (\"hefe\" means yeast and \"weizen\" refers to wheat), combines pure wheat flavor with Bayern's own strain of yeast. Bayern's Hefeweizen is hopped moderately with Hallertauer Perle from Germany, has an alcohol content of 5.4% Alcohol by Volume (13.1% Plato o.g.) and is made using malted wheat, pale and caramel malt. The hefeweizen beer style was invented in Bavaria and Bayern Brewing's version is one of the very few that is actually brewed as it is in Bavaria by a Bavarian Brewmaster. So if you are interested in this style of beer, try this one first and see how the other ones compare to the original. \r\n\r\n St. Wilbur Weizen is brewed using the recipe of the old Brauerei zum Schiff brewery in Kaufbeuren, Germany, which is located 60 miles southwest of Munich and was established in 1540. Jürgen Knöller, the owner of Bayern Brewing, apprenticed in this brewery from 1978 to 1981 and brought this original recipe to Missoula in 1987. \r\n\r\n In 2002, Jürgen decided to rename Bayern's Hefeweizen \"St Wilbur Weizen\" after his beloved St. Bernard, Wilbur, who had been adopted from the Humane Society. Sympathetic with the issues of these large breed dogs, Bayern now donates a portion of sales of this beer style and all affiliated merchandise to the Saint Bernard Rescue Foundation. To learn more about this, please read this edition of our Brewsletter. Whenever you think about Wilbur, just remember this: HE MAY BE A SAINT, BUT HE'S NO ANGEL!",

After the beer is finished fermenting, it is dry hopped which entails adding hops for several days to impart an aromatic hop nose to the beer. When quaffed, the beer finishes cleanly with almost no residual hop bitterness and is a particular delight with most subtly flavored foods. This beer was named after the patron saint of headaches in consideration of all beer lovers who may occasionally be over served.",

This beer is aged with the intention of imparting the particularly unique character of the wood and/or what has previously been in the barrel. New wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and/or other unique wood character but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Used sherry, rum, bourbon, scotch, port, wine and other barrels are often used, imparting complexity and uniqueness to beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Primary character of the beer style may or may not be apparent. Sour wood-aged beer of any color is outlined in other categories. Dark fruited or spiced beer would also be appropriately entered in this category. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character.  The brewer should explain the special nature of the beer to allow for accurate judging. Comments could include: type of wood used (new or old, oak or other wood type), type of barrel used (new, port/ whiskey/ wine/ sherry/ other), base beer style or achieved character. Beer entries not accompanied by this information will be at a disadvantage during judging.",
