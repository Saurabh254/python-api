      "description": "We're best known for brewing aggressive, big-character beers, but we love a great sessionable ale as much as anyone. Most beers at the less-weighty end of the spectrum lack flavor and depth as much as they lack high ABVs, but not Stone Levitation Ale! This deep amber brew has a rich maltiness, big hoppy character, citrus overtones, and an impressively modest alcohol content for a beer with so much flavor packed into it.",

It was highlighted in our Stone hop revolver single ipa series, and with the featured hop in our hugely popular 2017 summer seasonal beer: Stone ghost hammer IPA. Then there's Dr. Rudi , which has been around since 1976. Originally known as a super alpha, this hop brings classic resin and piney notes, which pair it perfectly with the floral citrusy aroma of loral. Traditionalist GenX meets adventurous Millennial. What do they talk about? Nothing, hops don't talk. Together however, they speak. It's apparent that a pairing like this was bound to happen. At Stone we call it inevitable.",

The two became fast friends and their companies have enjoyed collaborating in many different ways over the years since.\r\n\r\nWith this special beer, Garrett & Greg introduce you to the welcoming spirit of the Aloha State. Echoing their past collaborations, this beer abounds with ingredients familiar to the islands—rich coffee and pounds of hand-toasted coconut—and introduces hazelnuts into the mix. The result is deeply rooted in Hawaii, San Diego, Europe and friendship, capturing the true essence of the word “aloha,” which also means on a deeper level “joyfully sharing life.” So sit back and slip into island time with this imperial beauty. Cheers, prost & ‘okole maluna!",

The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.",

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

Big-beer focus groups prove consumers get a kick out of them, and macrobrew marketing analyses suggest they sell well. But for us, beer comes first, much as Stone Smoked Porter came first. Actually, it came second—oddly enough, in the form of a seasonal. Our co-founder and original brewmaster, Steve Wagner, thought it would be an innovative, warming creation suited for winter…and it was. Legend has it Greg’s mom agreed. But rather than relegating fans to nine peat-smoked-porterless months and building revenue-generating fervor for the cold season, we made it a year-round release. Nowadays, we brew a trio of tasty takes on this smoky, sultry vanguard. But the closest they come to being “seasonals” is that they are enhanced with seasonally driven ingredients such as vanilla bean and chipotle peppers. This version, released in the literally gray area separating sunshine and snowfall, incorporates dark chocolate and dried orange peel, making for a semisweet, citrus-nuanced porter that comes across like a break-apart chocolate orange enjoyed by a campfire. It’s not a seasonal—it’s just a phenomenal beer, regardless of the time of year. Throw out the calendar and enjoy.",

      "description": "There’s nothing simple or run of the mill about this “little pod” harvested from the finicky vines of vanilla orchids found on Indian Ocean islands. The thousands of richly aromatic seeds buried inside each of these plump vanilla fruit pods became our beer-making muse for this porter recipe distinguished by chocolate malt and Madagascar vanilla bean. This latter luxe ingredient imparts a delicate creaminess and palate-seducing softness. Additionally, its presence heightens the roundness of the chocolate undertones and hints of coffee typically associated with beers of this style. Dripping in the world’s second-most expensive spice, this porter is extremely drinkable, with just the right amount of vanilla bean richness and deepness.",

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

This will allow more surface contact time with the hops and beer fully maximizing the aroma and flavors from the hops. The addition of Citra Hops deliver a spicy, floral, strong citrus and tropical tone of grapefruit, melon, lime, gooseberry, passion fruit and lychee.\r\n\r\nStonefly IPA will continue to support the efforts of the Schuylkill Action Network and donate a portion of proceeds to the Berks Watershed Restoration Fund to protect the source waters and health of the Schuylkill River watershed.",

        "description": "Scotch ales are overwhelmingly malty and full-bodied. Perception of hop bitterness is very low. Hop flavor and aroma are very low or nonexistent. Color ranges from deep copper to brown. The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).",

Instead we use a boat load of rich, decadent golden colored English barley, flaked barley, flaked oats, and flaked wheat to give it lush body and smooth sweetness. We then ferment it on Cocoa Nibs and add fresh locally roasted Guatemalan Coffee, directly to the fermenter. The cocoa nibs and coffee add the rich mocha notes and bright roasty/coffee aroma you might typically find in a stout. We are excited to partner with Redding Roasters Coffee Company of Bethel, CT on this mind bending beer.",

Hops from a variety of origins may be used to contribute to a high hopping rate. Earthy and herbal English-variety hop character is the perceived end, but may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer, sometimes with subtle and balanced character of sulfur compounds. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a medium to high, flowery hop aroma and may have a medium to strong hop flavor (in addition to the hop bitterness). English-style India pale ales possess medium maltiness and body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional English character.",

We asked our brewers to put their collective heads together and come up with a brand-new winter ale to which we could apply the moniker; a few test batches and lots of customer input later and viola!, we have Storm Surge Winter Ale!\r\n \r\nThis is pretty complicated beer, at least by our standards (we normally love the old saying “Keep it simple, stupid!”).  We use 2-row pale malt, German Carared, Caramel 80, Carapils and Munich malts in the mash, then just before beginning to extract all the goodness from those malts, we sprinkle crushed Midnight Wheat over the grain bed to ‘stain’ the mash. \r\n\r\nThe effect of this little bit of brewhouse trickery is to pull only the color from the wheat while extracting just a hint of its roasty, coffee-like qualities.  Additions of a whole boatload of Chinook, Cascade, Simcoe and Columbus hops give this beer a lovely, layered bitterness that perfectly complements the complexity of the malts.  It’s very dark in color, but don’t let appearances deceive you; this beer is highly drinkable and perfect for those cold, stormy winter days when you want to dream of Spring.",
