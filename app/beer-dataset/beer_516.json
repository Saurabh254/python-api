These guys take maple syrup making as seriously as we take great beer brewing. These discerning monks have given Third Street Brewhouse exclusive rights (yep, that means just us) to pair their notorious sweet blend with our perfectly crafted beer so we can bring you the Sugar Shack Maple Stout. Special thanks to the Saint John’s Abbey Arboretum & Forest in Collegeville, MN.",

Travel around the United States and Europe first fueled their interest in establishing unique, local ventures guided by quality and passion. Producing fresh, hand-crafted products with local ingredients whenever possible is paramount to them, as is their understanding that the community is the heart and soul that connects people with what they love most about their town. We hope you enjoy this luscious, donut-inspired samoa porter, with decadent flavors of caramel, toasted coconut and dark chocolate. Ian and Neil would also like to personally thank all of the hard-working folks at Sugar Shack and Strangeways for everything they do on a daily basis to make fresh, local products like this one possible. Cheers to collaboration and community!",

The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category.

Similarly, Fort George has chosen to craft beer that is often outside the beer style guidelines. This year’s spring collaboration with Suicide Squeeze Records is one of those beers – a crisp session IPA with every bit of the hoppy flavor and aroma you’ve come to expect from Fort George. Floral and citrusy, Suicide Squeeze IPA is a light ode to spring.\r\n\r\nVISIT SUICIDESQUEEZE.NET/FORTGEORGE TO DOWNLOAD A FREE MUSIC SAMPLER",

Torrefied and/or malted wheat are often used in quantities of 25% or less. Malt flavor may be biscuit-like. English, American or Noble-type hop, character, flavor and aroma are evident and may or may not be assertive yet always well balanced with malt character. Mild carbonation traditionally characterizes draft-cask versions. In bottled versions, normal or lively carbon dioxide content is appropriate. The overall impression is refreshing and thirst quenching. Fruity-ester characters are acceptable at low to moderate levels. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",

Available on tap and in 16oz cans from May – August, the Summer Ale is too good to miss! \r\n\r\nQuality Supreme: Narragansett Summer is a light session ale made with two row pale malt and citra hops. The citra hops are a very popular, newer variety that deliver aromas of citrus and passion fruit without overpowering the taste buds. The beer is blonde in color and the mild kiss of the hops complement the pale malt perfectly, making it extremely drinkable. The draft is brewed in small batches at Trinity Brew House in Providence and Cottrell Brewery in Pawcatuck, CT, and the tall boy cans are brewed at High Falls Brewery in Rochester, NY.

        "description": "American pale ales range from deep golden to copper in color. The style is characterized by fruity, floral and citrus-like American-variety hop character producing medium to medium-high hop bitterness, flavor, and aroma. Note that the \"traditional\" style of this beer has its origins with certain floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American hop varietals. One or more of these hop characters is the perceived end, but the perceived hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. American pale ales have medium body and low to medium maltiness. Low caramel character is allowable. Fruity-ester flavor and aroma should be moderate to strong. Diacetyl should be absent or present at very low levels. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures.",

For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style.
