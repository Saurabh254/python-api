They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.",

      "description": "We're combining elements of Duvel's classic golden ale with Sierra Nevada's hop-forward fanaticism to create a new beer that highlights both. The complex fruity nature of Duvel's signature yeast is the first thing that greets you, followed shortly but a blast of bright, citrusy hops. The beer also has a touch of lemon peel for a po that greets the palate right at the finish of this deceptively drinkable and complex beer.",

The idea behind this beer for Beer Camp Across the World is actually not to \"collaborate\" at all, but, rather, to brew the exact recipe for Sierra Nevada's Bigfoot and the exact recipe of for Avery's Hog Heaven and blend the two distinct finished beers together, and then bottle condition a new version of these two classic beers. The resulting brew is lovingly dubbed \"Big Hog\" or \"HogFoot\" depending on the brewer's preference. It's big, intense, and hoppy. Great fresh or the perfect candidate for aging down the line.",

A caramel and/or toffee aroma and flavor are often part of the character. Characters indicating oxidation, such as vinous (sometimes sherry-like) aromas and/or flavors, are not generally acceptable in American-style Barley Wine Ale, however if a low level of age-induced oxidation character harmonizes and enhances the overall experience this can be regarded favorably.

      "description": "Together we're brewing a riff on the flavors of the classic raspberry ice cream sundae. This beer features raspberry, cocoa and vanilla, in addition to lactose (an unfermentable sugar) that adds a richness and a sweetness, helping to blend and meld the flavors of this ultra-complex beer together. It's been a true pleasure to work with the artists at The Bruery using ingredients and techniques outside of our normal wheelhouse.",

The fussy Southeast Asian animals only eat the best and ripest coffee berries.Enzymes in their digestive system help to break down the bean. Workers collect the bean-containing droppings for Civet or Weasel Coffee. The exceedingly rare Civet Coffee has a strong taste and an even stronger aroma.",

After that it’s a question of out of the barrel, into a bottle and off you go.\r\n\r\nThis beer pours black with a creamy beige head. Aroma is packed with notes of caramel, coffee, vanilla, wood and cognac booziness. On the palate is pleasantly sweet with balanced bitterness. Flavor is also boozy, with hints of oak, vanilla, coffee and dark chocolate, followed by a malty and oaky finish.",

Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.",

Not overly sweet by any means, organic Cascade hops balance the malt syrup sweetness, finishing slightly spicy with a pleasurable alcohol warmth. We recommend serving Beer Line as an after-dinner digestif. It will pair well with the sharp flavors of an American-style Gorgonzola or a five year cheddar.
