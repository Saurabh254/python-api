Coriander and light orange peel aroma should be perceived as such or as an unidentified spiciness. Phenolic spiciness and yeast flavors may be evident at mild levels. These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.",

Fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is usually straw to light amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. Because this style is served with yeast the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Chill haze is also acceptable. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of malt and hops. These beers are typically served with the yeast in the bottle, and are cloudy when served.",

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.",

Inspired by the traditional smoked beers from Bamberg, it is amber with red highlights and a strong smoked flavor blending with hints of caramel and dried fruit.\r\n“To a summer that won’t come back towards a future of great emotions.”\r\n\r\nABV. 5,2% 13°P\r\n\r\nI created this beer to celebrate my wedding and my bride who has always loved Rauch beers. The city of Bamberg is particularly dear to us. We ventured through its streets, indulged in its well known smoked beers and stood together contemplating the water ripples of the river Regnitz.\r\n Being in Tettnang 2 days before the wedding to select the newly harvested hops, I brought back 10 freshly uprooted hop plants to decorate the wedding reception. Instead of the traditional rice tossing, the guests showered us with hop flowers. My weeding suit was garmented by a small hop blossom as well. With more than 200 guests and 450 liters of beer, many remember our celebration as one of the most memorable gatherings they have ever attended.\r\n Selling the leftover beer to some clients was such a success that we decided to keep brewing it. It is now part of our beer family!",

Hop flavor or aroma should not be perceived. Scottish heavy ale will have a medium degree of malty, caramel-like, soft and chewy character in flavor and mouthfeel. It has medium body, and fruity esters are very low, if evident. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scottish-style heavy ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).",

The strongest version of the Scottish beer style was called a “wee heavy” and was typically served in smaller, 6-­ounce, a “wee” bit of “heavy” ale.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nO’Fallon Wee Heavy is our nod to the era and the style. It’s a malt-­forward beer with subtle hints of roasted malts and cherry wood and nutty flavors with just enough hop bitterness to support the big malt backbone and balance its sweetness. This beer was fermented at cooler temperatures to reduce the esters (fruitiness) of the yeast and create a very clean and smooth profile for a beer with an 8.5% ABV.",

Hop flavor or aroma should not be perceived. Scottish heavy ale will have a medium degree of malty, caramel-like, soft and chewy character in flavor and mouthfeel. It has medium body, and fruity esters are very low, if evident. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels.

Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low to medium levels (ales with medium-high or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category).

It has medium body, and fruity esters are very low, if evident. Yeast characters such as diacetyl (butterscotch) and sulfuriness are acceptable at very low levels. The color will range from golden amber to deep brown. Bottled versions of this traditional draft beer may contain higher amounts of carbon dioxide than is typical for mildly carbonated draft versions. Chill haze is acceptable at low temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made Scottish-style heavy ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scottish-style heavy ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels.

        "description": "Scotch ales are overwhelmingly malty and full-bodied. Perception of hop bitterness is very low. Hop flavor and aroma are very low or nonexistent. Color ranges from deep copper to brown. The clean alcohol flavor balances the rich and dominant sweet maltiness in flavor and aroma. A caramel character is often a part of the profile. Dark roasted malt flavors and aroma may be evident at low levels. If present, fruity esters are generally at low aromatic and flavor levels. Low diacetyl levels are acceptable. Chill haze is allowable at cold temperatures. Though there is little evidence suggesting that traditionally made strong Scotch ales exhibited peat smoke character, the current marketplace offers many Scotch Ales with peat or smoke character present at low to medium levels. Thus a peaty/smoky character may be evident at low levels (ales with medium or higher smoke character would be considered a smoke flavored beer and considered in another category). Scotch Ales may be split into two subcategories: Traditional (no smoke character) and Peated (low level of peat smoke character).",

These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level.

      "description": "We took a batch of Louie’s Demise and added a bunch of Rishi’s Organic Blueberry Rooibos and Hibiscus Tea blends  to our secondary fermentation vessel. After two weeks of cold infusion we filtered out the tea, carbonated it.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 2011 we created a sessionable version of our Louie’s Demise. We added Rishi’s Organic Blueberry Rooibos and Hibiscus Tea blends to our secondary fermentation vessels and after about 2 weeks of cold infusion we filtered out the tea and carbonated it.\r\n\r\nDuring the initial brew, we get a lot of the caramel and earthy malt aromas that we expect from brewing Louie’s, The blueberry and hibiscus smells explode after fermentation, it was surprisinig how intese they were after such a short period of time. Working with nontraditional ingredients was really exciting, however we had no idea what the cold infusion would do to such a light flavored beer. With no benchmark, we just guessed on the quantities.\r\n\r\nThis is an unusal beer, but it’s perfect for a hot afternoon when you’re looking for something refreshing.",

Nuts generally have some degree of fermentables, thus beers brewed with nuts would appropriately be entered in this category. The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.",

These beers are traditionally bottle conditioned and served cloudy. An unfiltered starch and yeast haze should be part of the appearance. The low to medium body should have some degree of creaminess from wheat starch. The style is further characterized by the use of noble-type hops to achieve low hop bitterness and little to no apparent hop flavor. This beer has no diacetyl and a low to medium fruity-ester level. Mild acidity is appropriate.",

Perceived impression of bitterness is soft and well-integrated into overall balance, and may differ significantly from measured or calculated IBU levels.\r\n\r\nFermentation Characteristics: Low to medium fruity-estery aroma and ﬂavor may be present, but are usually overwhelmed by hop character. Diacetyl should not be perceived.\r\n\r\nBody: Medium to high. Perceived silky or full mouthfeel may contribute to overall flavor profile.\r\n\r\nAdditional notes: Grist may include a small amount of oat, wheat or other adjuncts to promote haziness. Descriptors such as “juicy” are often used to describe the taste and aroma hop-derived attributes present in these beers.",
