      "description": "This stealth-fully hoppy Black IPA was created by our assistant brewer Justin who served in the 3rd Ranger Battalion. Black Hog Down Black IPA packs an arsenal of six different big hops including Ella and Citra for a demolition evoking 63 IBUs and a homage to the Sikorsky BlackHawk UH63…. coincidence… NO SIR! Big spicy black tea and citrus on the tongue tactically attack your taste buds alongside a dark smooth malty back bone. Dry hopped with a blend of Citra, Cascade and Super Galena for a blast of clean citrus aromatic that disorients your perceptions of what a palette assault from a monster jet black bad ass brew should be. Go Drink one, that’s an order!",

Color is dark brown to black. Bitterness is moderate, not high. Hop flavor and aroma are optional but should not overpower the overall balance if present. This is a medium- to full- bodied beer, with minimal fruity esters. Diacetyl should be absent or at extremely low levels. Original gravity range and alcohol levels are indicative of English tradition of oatmeal stout.",

The distinctive characters of these special ingredients should be evident either in the aroma, flavor or overall balance of the beer, but not necessarily in overpowering quantities. For example, maple syrup or potatoes would be considered unusual. Rice, corn, or wheat are not considered unusual. Special ingredients must be listed when competing. A statement by the brewer explaining the special nature of the beer, ingredient(s) and achieved character is essential in order for fair assessment in competitions. If this beer is a classic style with some specialty ingredient(s), the brewer should also specify the classic style. Guidelines for competing: Spiced beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the experimental category. Fruit beers using unusual fermentables should be entered in the fruit beer category.",

They range from deep golden to medium copper in color. The style may use any variety of hops. Though the hop character is intense it's balanced with complex alcohol flavors, moderate to high fruity esters and medium to high malt character. Hop character should be fresh and lively and should not be harsh in quality. The use of large amounts of hops may cause a degree of appropriate hop haze. Imperial or Double India Pale Ales have medium-high to full body. Diacetyl should not be perceived. The intention of this style of beer is to exhibit the fresh and bright character of hops. Oxidative character and aged character should not be present.",

The style is further characterized by floral, fruity, citrus-like, piney, resinous, or sulfur-like American-variety hop character. Note that one or more of these American-variety hop characters is the perceived end, but the hop characters may be a result of the skillful use of hops of other national origins. The use of water with high mineral content results in a crisp, dry beer. This pale gold to deep copper-colored ale has a full, flowery hop aroma and may have a strong hop flavor (in addition to the perception of hop bitterness). India pale ales possess medium maltiness which contributes to a medium body. Fruity-ester flavors and aromas are moderate to very strong. Diacetyl can be absent or may be perceived at very low levels. Chill and/or hop haze is allowable at cold temperatures. (English and citrus-like American hops are considered enough of a distinction justifying separate American-style IPA and English-style IPA categories or subcategories. Hops of other origins may be used for bitterness or approximating traditional American or English character. See English-style India Pale Ale",

A variety of Columbus and Cascade hops were used quite generously to help balance out the large malt bill. This beer is abundant with in complex flavors and hop character and yet quite smooth for a beer that sits at 7.5% abv and 48 IBUs. Cheers!\r\n\r\nThe style “India Black Ale” is so new, that there’s no one, all authoritative beer that we need to compare to. The trick is to get the balance between the malt bitterness and the hop bitterness. In this case we used non-astringent roasted malts to add the roasted flavors. The malt is a de-husked German black malt, it provides the color, and the roast flavor without the risk of extra acidity. It creates this intense roasted coffee and chocolate aroma. When we add the hops you’ll get that pine and citrus smell. When we released the test batch last year it went over really well. I drink the IBA when I have the time to really savor it and when it has the chance to come up to room temperature.",

Black Kettle Chocolate Stout is made with roasted barley and chocolate malt, as well as a heaping amount of cocoa powder, cocoa nibs, vanilla beans, and cinnamon sticks added to the kettle. It pours the color of onyx, and is topped with a fluffy, tan head. The aroma is reminiscent of roasted espresso beans and decedent chocolate, with a tinge of cinnamon spice. A throwback to our original recipe, Black Kettle Chocolate Stout leaves you in peace with a pleasant, lingering sweetness.",
